The game is capturing that grace period in a childhood where playing dress up was larger than life and changed the environments around you. <br><br>At its core Where the Bees Make Honey is a puzzle adventure game, but gameplay variation is filtered throughout. When game's main character Sunny is an adult reflecting on the times when she was young, the game is played in a first-person perspective. This transition period takes place at her workplace, where she is ultimately at a crossroads with what to do next in her life.<br><br>Playable vignettes allow for the game to transition into each season. This allows for a more focused approach for storytelling and player engagement. The vignettes offer an additional perspective of the season they precede. The gameplay varies considerably between seasons, vignettes, and moments.<br><br>An Xbox One controller or equivalent is recommended, and is supported fully beyond the launcher. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1001640/extras/GameSpot.png?t=1553616004\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1001640/extras/gif1.gif?t=1553616004\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1001640/extras/gif2.gif?t=1553616004\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1001640/extras/gif3.gif?t=1553616004\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1001640/extras/gif5.gif?t=1553616004\" >",
