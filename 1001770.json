            "detailed_description": "Catharsis is a metaphor for the purging of toxic emotions from the mind first coined by Aristotle. For some time it was also central to Sigmund Freud's theory of Psychoanalysis. I wanted to create a tool for the purging of my own violent thoughts. The theory is as such: Using the tool of sentiment analysis, we can detect and measure a person's mood through their words. Coupled with feedback of a violent nature, it can be used to temporarily free the mind of pent up aggressive thoughts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough most modern research has shown results to the contrary (Cathartic actions and venting makes people angrier rather than draining them of the toxic emotions), I wanted to push the experiment further to see the results. The aim of the game is to create a way for people to vent their frustrations and get a temporary feeling of catharsis.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay consists of you typing in your feelings. The more negative your feelings, as determined by the sentiment analysis, the faster your score rises.",
