Coupled with audio-visual feedback of a violent nature, it can be used to temporarily free the mind of pent up aggressive thoughts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay consists of you choking your tormentor till they die. You type in your feelings. The more negative your feelings, as determined by the sentiment analysis, the faster you choke your victim.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough most modern research has shown results to the contrary (Cathartic actions and venting makes people angrier rather than draining them of the toxic emotions), I wanted to push the experiment further to see the results.
