No. In this game you will be the man behind the desk. Or a woman. We are talking about the lifestyle of the real archeologists, the true horror of dealing with traumas and phobias. Not yours! You won't risk your own health, we have employees to do that. The true horror of dealing with their traumas and phobias. Do you see where I'm going with it? Imagine the bills from doctors, the health compensations and the press. &quot;Press? Why the press?&quot; you ask. Yes, the press. Because you know the press.
