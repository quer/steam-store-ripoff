Explore the facility, find hidden patches, unlock secret rooms. You can interact with almost every object in the game. <br><br><strong> <br>The Story</strong> <br>You suddenly have waken up in an unknown dimension in a middle of nowhere. What happened to you? Is this an experiment you &quot;voluntarily&quot; participated in? Or maybe you're experimenting on yourself? <br><br><br><strong> <br>Intoducing... The Delta Labs Photonic Energy Manipulator! <br><br>The main feature of the game is a gun that can absorb any type of energy and then use it!</strong> <br><br>For example, the energy absorbed from a light bulb will give your gun the ability to shoot low power laser. Absorbing force fields scattered all around the lab will make your gun shoot a ray that can immobilize objects, absorbing gamma radiation will turn your gun into a death ray, etc.",
