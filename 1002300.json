Four misfortuned adventurers dwell deeper and deeper to the darkness and uncover the secrets this ancient fortress holds inside. The fortress works as an ancient nexus for different planes of existence. The depths are in an eternal turmoil as both old and new gods struggle for power, it’s up to the players to choose their position and stance in all of this.<br><br>The game is a hybrid of survival horror and dungeon crawler genres with its influences ranging from Silent Hill to Nethack.

You can target individual limbs of your enemies to dismember them strategically and thus maximize your chances for survival.

But don’t forget that running away from threats is often the best solution as well. There are many ways for survival in Fear &amp; Hunger - You can find better equipment, learn different blood and love magic, fuse characters into each other, pray different gods, talk your way out of battles, meet new party members, snipe enemies from distance, use traps to disable them… and so on. The Idea is to use what you got at your disposal and be creative with it.",
