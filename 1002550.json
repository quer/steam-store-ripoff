The addiction phase lasts for 90 days.<br><br>The addiction phase also follows the law of diminishing returns. Ask anybody addicted to substances - you never get back the magic of that “first hit”. So every subsequent day that you play the game gets less flashy and more boring till you hit a plateau and then you have to keep on dredging (if you choose to) along just to keep the game (your life). The players who play for the whole 90 days get the addict achievement - They will have fully experienced the mechanics of addiction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1002550/extras/something4.png?t=1551148364\" ></h2><br>The &quot;First Hit&quot; DLC restores the game state to that of that first hit. It also removes the play at least once every 24 hours condition. You can play it anytime you want and you get the full effect of the acid aesthetic every time you play when you buy the DLC. It also lets you compete in the leaderboards and unlocks many more achievements.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1002550/extras/something5.png?t=1551148364\" ></h2><br>I want people to experience the real helplessness of being a substance abuser. It derives from my own relationship with substance abuse. I wanted to capture the feeling of having to do something that they have no control over. This is the closest I could get to that concept, in game form.<br><br>The first hit is free. Then you pay with your time! And remember kids - Stay in drugs, Don’t do school.",
