The main drug discussed is a fictional drug called MinX, and several party members in the game are police officers who are involved in drug seizures.\r\n\r\nCharacters wear revealing outfits and there are ten different love interests that can be romanced. The game does not contain graphic content, and any depictions of nudity are heavily pixelated."
