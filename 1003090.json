Too few are standing up against the monstrosity of the German Reich. Will you? Lead an underground resistance group Through the Darkest of Times.  <br>In this strategy game, based on historical events, you plan the actions of your fighters. But what can you do? Fight? A whole army, a whole nation against your group of five. So you have to act carefully and win the hearts and minds of the people, gather more followers, gain more support. <br>And most important: stay alive. You are always in grave danger, if the Gestapo (Germany’s Secret Service Police during the Third Reich) finds out what you are doing, you might end up in prison or worse. <br><br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1003090/extras/TTDOT_banner_rebels.gif?t=1558349508\" ><br><br><i>Plan.

You assign your comrades on important tasks: Produce leaflets or write messages on walls to inform the people what the Nazis are up to. Gather intel about Nazi-Operations and make them public. Sabotage. The bolder you are, the higher the risk – but you want to change something, right? Divided into 4 Chapters, Through the Darkest of Times follows the actual events of the Third Reich era, but your actions have a meaningful impact on your life, the life of your group’s members and many people around you.   <br>Your members are procedurally generated on each playthrough. They come with different personalities, abilities and views.
