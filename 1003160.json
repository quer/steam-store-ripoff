To this end, he has been gifted the lethal Blade of Ancient Skies, made from the jawbone of a long extinct giant predator, and the Mask of Heavens, allowing him to meld his consciousness with the Terradons as though they are one.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1003160/extras/Tiktaq'to_Campaign.gif?t=1571755080\" /><br><br>Tiktaq’To is a paragon of aerial combat, and inspires those around him to great feats.
