Each player is given 3 re-rolls per game that they may use to replace newly-revealed letters with a different letter, for a chance at more matches on screen. The game features 3 game modes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><br>* Score Attack - All instances of a revealed letter are awarded to the player. Player reveals all letters, then play switches to the next player.<br>* Strategy Mode - Players can only select 3 of the instances of revealed letters on screen. When all letters have been revealed, play switches to the next player.<br>* Versus Mode - Players can only select 3 of the instances of revealed letters on screen. Both players are working off the same screen and can absorb opponent pieces via having a scored tile to the opposing sides (of left and right, or above and bellow) of a piece or pieces to absorb them. Players take turns, as play changes to the next player after &quot;End Turn&quot; is selected.</li></ul><br>Goal of the game is to get the best score. Scoring of complete words will earn the player bonus points.",
