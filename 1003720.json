Well, aside from the fact that sticking the word &quot;Super&quot; in front of everything makes it better, <i>this</i> demo also allows you to play the game fully online, as much as you like! And you can even start progressing through the game, earning items and animal DNA. These items you earn in the demo are locked, so you won't be able to unlock new Super Animals or dress them up to make them your own, but if you like the game and choose to purchase it, all of the items you've unlocked and progress you've earned will transfer right into the full game! That's pretty <i>Super,</i> right? Hopefully not so super that you'll avoid supporting development of the game, but we're really proud of what we've built and the community that has grown around it, so we hope that giving you the chance to experience it for yourself will show you that it's an Early Access game worth supporting!<br><br>The demo starts you off with 4 Super Animal breeds, but to unlock the remaining animals you'll need to get the full version so you can unlock your animal DNA and Super Serum, and start combining them to create new Super Animals!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the game:</h2><br>Super Animal Royale is an intense, strategic, top-down 2D twist on the battle royale genre. Up to 64 adorably murderous animals fight tooth and claw (and machine gun) across diverse, exotic biomes, each vying for top dog (or top cat, or top sloth...you get the idea). In the demo, you'll be able to play as the fox, bear, skullcat and tiger.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Enjoy atmospheric battle royale action from a whole new top down perspective.<br></li><li>An intuitive fog of war system enables sneaky, strategic play.<br></li><li>Explore a massive, beautifully illustrated island paradise, with diverse biomes and the cryptic remains of a super safari park gone awry.<br></li><li>Chop the tall grass to find hidden items, because that’s what you do with tall grass.</li></ul><br>The top down view and streamlined mechanics make this the most accessible battle royale yet, while surprisingly deep strategy and a high skill cap rewards more advanced players. The game has also been optimized to run smoothly whether you play on a Macbook or a beastly gaming PC.<br><br>The island and roster of genetically engineered super animals are constantly (ahem) evolving with updates. Your super animal can be customized with new outfits, tombstones, death explosions, weapons, dance moves, and more, so you can look your best as you do your worst (but although you can start collecting these in the demo, you'll need the full version to equip them).",
