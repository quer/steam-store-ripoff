Hornet, a new ship with an experimental engine that allows it to warp behind enemy lines. Launching your small fighter craft from the Hornet, your mission is to sabotage the enemy by raiding their bases and disrupting their power supply network made up of reactor cores connected through hyperspace.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FAST-PACED ACTION</h2><br>There are plenty of enemies and they are out to get you. Fly, fight, and maneuver through dangerous enemy bases and intense gravitational fields.
