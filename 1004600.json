The player walks in first person. The game does not have buttons to say to click here or there, because inside the game there is a ball that is a smart computer and tells what you have to do. He speaks many things, takes good notice of what he has to say. The game has ambient sounds, some songs. 3D models are very simple in LowPoly. The purpose of this first episode is to start many episodes with little adventures that linked will make a story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI do not like to sell cat by hare, so:<br />\r\nTo be honest, this game is very small, very simple, but I think it's very cute and with some imagination.<br />\r\nThank you all.",

A simple plot with not straining tasks. The game is for fans, so the choice is yours.”<br><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32826090-Gaming-Grandma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Gaming Grandma</a><br><br>“A short proof-of-concept that is light on gameplay but full of potential, in my opinion. Personally, it's the simplistic art style that I liked the most. It's all custom-made assets and backgrounds as far as I can tell and it's all very cohesive. It's also very colorful which is a nice change of pace from most other space sci-fi games.”<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UJt5_LC17cIQW8e8iwe6Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Gray Suede</a><br>",
