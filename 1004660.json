I'm Masa Murda! Once upon a time my people were traveling through space trying to find a new planet to live on because we totally wrecked our old one.

She's got a lot of incentive to get things right, because our cannibal friends threatened to eat her if she screws up. <br><br>Actually, they'll eat all of us if she screws up.  Did I mention they turn into berserk monsters when they get too hungry?  They rampage and start eating people alive--it's hilarious!<br><br>Faleena's actually pretty good at her job--probably too good, because we colonists hate her.

Earn stats and activate flags that will keep both your people and the cannibals happy.

Decide how much or little to trust your best friend, the cannibal Dal-Tor, and choose how to use resources to benefit the future of colony or the cannibal-human alliance.

To the surprise of everyone, Faleena not only accepted her husband's former post, but appears to be governing in favor of the cannibals who ate him.  The reasons why are likely only known by her closest friend, the cannibal Dal-Tor.  Faleena does her best to govern the colony while raising the baby born after her husband's death.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1004660/extras/daltor.png?t=1549655695\" ><br><strong>Provider Emissary Dal-Tor</strong><br>Dal-Tor is the intermediary between the cannibals and humans and spends most of her time in Faleena's office.  Thousands of years old, she's found meaning in the deep relationship she has with Faleena and her daughter.  Both cannibals and humans question what her true interest is in Faleena.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1004660/extras/malek.png?t=1549655695\" ><br><strong>Vice Governor Malek</strong><br>While the governor is appointed to her seat, the vice governor Malek was elected by the people.  He always places their concerns over that of the cannibals, causing him to often butt heads with Faleena.

At 75 years old Sharin is deeply troubled by a policy that switches a younger lottery winner with a parent or grandparent.  Faleena's support of this policy has caused strife between them.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1004660/extras/crieghton.png?t=1549655695\" ><br><strong>Lord Crieghton, Ruler of the Providers</strong><br>Crieghton is the cannibal Faleena must answer to when she takes risks with the lotteries.  His goal is to feed his 34 people as much food as possible, and he resents the small rations they endure while the colony grows.
