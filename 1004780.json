Their father did not have a magical gift, he was making various household appliances. Their mother, Carolyn, was a skilful healer and selling herbs in a small market square. The family was not very rich, but they lived in prosperity.<br><br>Once, bandits attacked the village. It all started with the market. They needed money, goods items and magical artifacts ...

The guards were stabbed right away, the bandits began to kill the merchants. Carolyn was been killed.<br><br>After this incident, Noel's family fell into despair. Father stopped working and helping the village, stopped eating and talking to children. He constantly locked himself up in his workshop. Always worked on something. At this time, brother and sister, after long disputes, decided to collect the remaining gold coins and send Kate to study at the Higher Academy of Mages, in the capital.<br><i> &quot;You are very gifted, Kate&quot;</i>, said Noel. <i> &quot;You can become a real adept!&quot; </i><br><i> &quot;But what about our father? He’s health is completely bad! We need to take care of him, and even if I leave, you won’t have any gold left to...&quot; </i><br><i> &quot;I can do it&quot; </i>, Noel interrupted her. <i> &quot;I believe in you, and you will must believe in me!&quot; </i>.<br><br>Passed few months.

Two spells...<br>Everything around was wrapped in a mist of flowers, Noel and his father closed his eyes, and when the blinding and stunning was gone, Noel saw his father lay on the ground. In blood... He was dead. Noel did not have time to do anything, say anything, or even cry. Fire and water flooded everything around. Flames devoured trees and buildings ...
