But twenty years later across the metaphysical divide on I Alpha, a programming technician wakes up from visions of the incident and (believing it as just a nightmare) proceeds to simply cast if off and goes about his day... until consequences bring forth the same investigative associate who now finds herself many existential worlds away from home.
