As a renowned mystic investigator, acting on intuition and perspective, sets out to assist her divinity guard associates in matters related to a planned attack she ultimately comes up short and late to arrival, with the guard leader spared only for as long as her arrival is due which in turn sets up a divine incursion that seemingly destroys her as the force of integrity is fused on position. But twenty years later across the metaphysical divide on I Alpha, a material analysis technician wakes up from visions of the incident and (believing it as just a nightmare) proceeds to simply cast if off and goes about his day... until the morning commute gives way to a traffic jam caused by the same investigative associate who now finds herself many existential worlds away from home as a result of the incident. Matters are further complicated by the day's workload essentially blowing up in his face, leaving behind a massive fissure upon which a perfect storm of events results in an overnight split of the entire residential district, transported and integrated upon the fields of VI Delta itself.
