As a renowned mystic investigator, acting on intuition and perspective, sets out to assist her divinity guard associates in matters related to a planned attack she ultimately comes up short and late to arrival, with the guard leader spared only for as long as her arrival is due which in turn sets up a divine incursion that seemingly destroys her as the force of integrity is fused on position. But twenty years later across the metaphysical divide on I Alpha, a programming technician wakes up from visions of the incident and (believing it as just a nightmare) proceeds to simply cast if off and goes about his day... until consequences bring forth the same investigative associate who now finds herself many existential worlds away from home. But the problems started upon the world of the investigator’s origination extend deeper than anyone expected, and the divine essence is now threatening to implode upon itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPreview the first act of the coming advent with this starter experience as the unlikeliest of associates finds themselves in another part of the existential divide upon the core world that once served as the central point of integrity, trapped by the circumstance as they race to locate a close associate who jumped dimensions and deal with an unexpected reunion as the prospect of the situation becomes ever more apparent.",
