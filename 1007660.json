An ancient race of hardy underground warriors short in stature but long in memory. Traditionally charged with the duty of protecting the worlds riches and resources from being removed following the magnitudal upheaval it generates when such treasure are removed from their natural vaults deep in the earth. They have long since occupied the underground, pouring cart after cart of returned resources back into the heart to the world from which they came. This sacred duty often puts them at odds with those who would seek the extraction of such treasures. They are also the Keepers of the End Forge, a place where two types of fire combine their power generating temperatures hot enough to destroy unwanted artefacts.
