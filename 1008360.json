Rather, how like music could sounds in over a million years in the future.<br></li><li>The mood of the time of the UFO-Classics (and sightings of flying saucers) of the 60s, 70s &amp; 80s should be included.</li></ul><i>After a time-consuming search in the recording studio for the right instruments, we decided to use <strong>Output's</strong> virtual instruments.
