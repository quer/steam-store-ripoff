Each player can capture the ball by using their tractor beam, or try to dislodge the ball from another player by firing their weapon. If the ball has been captured the player can fire the ball at a target by releasing it from the tractor beam. The player can also score by ramming the ball, or hitting it with a weapon (propelling the ball into a goal area). Players can also try to dislodge the ball by colliding with another player (if they have captured the ball ).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls</h2>Each player can use the keyboard to control their jetpack, but a <strong><u>gamepad is strongly recommended</u></strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Players</h2>The game supports 1 or 2 players. A single player game allows a human player to compete against 3 AI opponents.<br>A multi-player game allows 2 human player to compete against 2 AI opponents via local split-screen.",
