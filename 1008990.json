You start in a wine cellar of a monastery, where by throwing a dice at the Trinity.Town logo different weapons appear. You can manipulate, smash and trash items. So you get a feel for the enviroment and the weapons to be used for martial arts training. <br>The next level is coming soon. It will contain a separate area for meditation.<br>We are looking forward to receiving your feedback! By the way, this can soon also be communicated directly via a forum created by us around the topic martial arts.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Virtual martial arts training and meditation</h2></u><br>You always wanted to practice your martial arts in a perfect environment.
