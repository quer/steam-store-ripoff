So you get a feel for the enviroment and the weapons to be used for martial arts training. <br>The next level is coming soon. It will contain a separate area for meditation.<br>We are looking forward to receiving your feedback! By the way, this can soon also be communicated directly via a forum created by us around the topic martial arts.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><u><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Visual Martial Arts Training and Meditation</h2></u><br>You always wanted to practice your martial arts in a perfect environment. You always wanted to train with your virtual Bo, Bokken or Kendo sequences?<br>The martial art also includes meditation. This brings peace, joy and tranquillity into your everyday life and gives strength for the ever new tasks you have to face every day. <i>Transform your home into an incredible training arena and a refuge for relaxation .</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The surroundings</h2>You will be teleported to an island to find in different buildings the best environment for you to train or meditate perfectly. Other areas are already under construction to inspire you in new ways.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Individual control</h2>Timers, times of day, music and much more can be individually adjusted to your needs so that you can concentrate on what is important to you. Next we will work on a Music Visualizer as well as a Radio and Spotify Integration.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Always new content</h2>We are constantly working on new environments and improving existing ones. More customizations, trainers, new voices, new music and much more in future free Early Access updates.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">From version 2.0 Guided Training Units</h2>We are working hard to provide you with virtual trainers where you can see the procedures and get tips. These Virtual Training Partners will be replicated with Motion Capture from real masters to give you the best templates for your training!
