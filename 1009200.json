In addition threre are so few games about war on the Eastern Front where so fierce and large battles took place. We wanted to create a game that allows player to fight both arcade and tactical, yet with the lighter toon and low-poly style. Tanks On The Eastern Front is our attempt at achieving this goal. Tank driving skill and utilization of environement in battle rule the day. No random deaths - there is always a way out, for the skilled player!",
