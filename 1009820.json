Just as she thought she was untouchable, she contracted a terrible affliction that she kept secret. Every day, she would perform rituals and cleanse her followers, hoping the god of pestilence and mayhem would forgive her. Her condition deteriorated as the plague overtook her body: her toes blackened, her neck mushroomed into cysts, and her throat gagged with blood vomit. The Plague uses her power, Vile Purge, to release a stream of vomit that infects her victims. A gauge controls the amount of time the Power lasts once launched. The Gauge starts empty. To fill it up, the player is required to charge his attack by holding down on the Power button. During the charging, The Plague suffers a speed movement penalty which ends when the power is released or when the charge reaches 100%. At that moment the movement speed is back to 100% of the base speed.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1009820/extras/Demise_Killer_Perks_header.png?t=1553013910\" ><br><br>The Plague comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dark Devotion </h2>The display of your powers creates a whirlwind of panic that spreads throughout the land.

Any Survivors who are within The Killer's terror radius while another Survivor is put into the dying state with a basic attack will yell and reveal their location to The Killer.<br><i>“Horror overcomes the heart of infidels who cry at the feet of the fallen.” (Hymn of Praise, 11. 4)</i><br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Corrupt Intervention</h2>Your prayers invoke a dark power that meddles with the Survivors’s chances of survival.

She built herself from the ground up, auditioning for commercials, leading radio-interviews, and guest-starring in variety shows. Her authentic delivery and sharp ad-libs, however, cost her dearly.

Survivors emit splashes of blood when attacked and leave pools of blood on the ground when injured. As the killer, players must find the survivors, from a first-person perspective, before they escape each level. Killers can use various weapons (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat hooks to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g., throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors; in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations.
