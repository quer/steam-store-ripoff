C., Chicago, and Los Angeles. Among Amtrak’s roster of diesel switchers is the venerable and unique “SW1000R.” Originally constructed by Electro-Motive in the 1950s as SW9 and SW1200 switchers, ten members of what became Amtrak’s SW1000R roster were acquired second-hand by Amtrak and rebuilt by locomotive remanufacturer NRE. <br><br>The SW1000R, which retained its classic EMD end-cab design after rebuild, is a 1,000-horsepower, four axle (B-B) diesel that is nimble and ideally suited for yard and shop switching duty -- and now you have the chance to put the veteran diesel to work around New York’s famed Sunnyside yard complex!<br><br>Originally developed in the 1960s by the Pennsylvania Railroad and U. S. Department of Transportation and built by the Budd Company, the electric-multiple-unit Metroliners were one of America’s first ventures into high-speed rail and were also a design predecessor of Amtrak’s Amfleet passenger equipment. <br><br>Operating over the Northeast Corridor, the Metroliners served for two decades, with Amtrak assuming their operations in 1971.
