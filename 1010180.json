Another good thing is that you can see that they don’t cheat, they are just “slightly” better than you. If you still think they cheat, it’s probably a visual bug.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Leaderboards</h2>There is a leaderboard per level… and a “Nightly run” leaderboard.

Broken English as an added bonus included free of charge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dress to impress</h2>We have some questionable skins. Buy them with in-game gold. Gold that you get by playing the game. Gold that you can't buy. No microtransactions :/.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">50-60 handcrafted levels</h2>... and more to come. As a free update. If we don't starve to death and change profession.
