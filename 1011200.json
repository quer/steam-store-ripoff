Also, we have added skill system to make the game more different. Besides,we have an escaping scene and an escape system in the game. Haha, you will like them.<br />\r\nPS: We have adapted English, Russian, Portuguese and Chinese, which should be enough for you to use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you hit the &quot;W&quot; key to jump in parkour, you can press the number keys &quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; to use three different skills.And skill 2 and 3 can be cancelled by pressing the &quot;S&quot; key during using. Skills need to obtain by picking up question mark items , but priority to obtain life. With a certain probability you will enter the forest scene, at this moment,press &quot;A&quot; or &quot;D&quot;  to run towards left or right. Press the &quot;S&quot; key exit the grass.There will be a reciprocal time in the scene. Before the time runs out, you must enter the grass which will show up in a random position after a period of time. And then you will avoid bird's prey, otherwise you will be caught and then enter the bird-claw scene. The bird-claw scene is very simple. You just keep pressing the &quot;H&quot; key until the red slot is full and you can break away and return to the parkour scene.",
