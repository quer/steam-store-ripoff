Evidently, a new design was required, and chief engineer Sir William Stanier was soon put to the task.<br><br>Ultimately, Stanier derived the new freight locomotive from his proven, mixed-traffic “Black 5”, switching from a 4-6-0 to a 2-8-0 wheel configuration to achieve a higher tractive effort. This made the new locomotives unsuitable for passenger locomotives as their overall top speed was reduced, but their ability to haul freight is what mattered most, and with a power rating of 8 (out of a possible 9), they were about to change the industry.<br><br>In total, a massive 852 LMS 8F locomotives would be built between 1935 and 1946, and not just for the LMS themselves, the design was chosen as the standard freight locomotive to be produced during the Second World War, meaning they were built and put to use across the country. The LNER had enough of them to even give them their own classification, the LNER O6, and the War Department wanted locomotives for the British Expeditionary Force – as such, many 8F were sent to work overseas in mainland Europe and beyond.<br><br>The 8Fs would continue operation right into the British Railways era, and lasted until the very end of steam, with most being retired in 1967 and 1968. Despite their huge numbers, only 14 survived into preservation, 6 of those in the UK, and only half of those have seen use since their retirement.
