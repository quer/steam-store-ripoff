Throughout the late 1940s and into the 1950s, EMD continued to update and refine its switcher models and, with the SW7 of 1949, Electro-Motive upped the horsepower of its 12-cylinder models to 1,200-horsepower. The SW9 of 1951 and SW1200 of 1954 continued the progression of 12-cylinder models while retaining the 1,200-hosepower rating.<br><br>Electro-Motive’s SW1200, which visually was nearly identical to its SW7 and SW9 predecessors, utilized the 567C version of EMD’s successful 12-cylinder power plant and enjoyed a production life extending from 1954 through 1966. Over those dozen years, more 70 buyers lined up to purchase 1,024 SW1200s which went to work throughout the Americas.<br> <br>Among the Class 1 railroad buyers of the SW1200 was the Rio Grande, which acquired ten units (D&amp;RGW 130-139) in December 1964 and January 1965. Dressed in the railroad’s flashy black and aspen gold livery, the SW1200s could be found working at notable locations on the D&amp;RGW, including Provo, Salt Lake City, and the famed Geneva Steel Works north of Provo.

And that’s not all! The D&amp;RGW SW1200 pack also includes a Rio Grande 50-foot insulated boxcar; 46-foot gondola (with multiple loads); 2-bay covered hopper – and Rio Grande’s handsome 01400-class caboose in six authentic liveries.<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>Four career scenarios featuring the D&amp;RGW EMD SW1200 on the Train Simulator Salt Lake City Route Extension (route available separately) are included:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>01-The Organizer<br></li><li>02-Collecting Goodies<br></li><li>03-Getting Ready<br></li><li>04-Working at Geneva</li></ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/774759/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Salt Lake City Route Extension</a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.</strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
