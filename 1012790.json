            "short_description": "Into the Radius is a single-player survival shooter for VR veterans. Stalk the Pechorsk Radius zone filled with surreal landscapes and dangerous anomalies. Use stealth, climbing or realistic firearms to explore, scavenge for loot and recover strange artifacts in an unforgiving dystopian environment.",
            "supported_languages": "English<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support",
            "reviews": "“Despite its flaws and unpolished nature, Into the Radius is still a good VR game worth playing if you’re a fan of the setting or looking for something dense to dig into. You can easily get upwards of 15 hours of content out of this game and the developers seem eager to continue working on it. Janky controls and some odd design decisions do not nullify the quality of the setting or the game’s underlying ideas. At its core, Into the Radius is an immersive and ambitious survival shooter on the fringe of humanity that pushes you to your limits.”<br>GOOD – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://uploadvr.com/into-the-radius-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >UploadVR</a><br><br>“Into the Radius covers a very large open world map made up of areas that are quite different from each others.  However, all of the areas are dangerous and a player must proceed slowly to avoid artifacts or attracting the attention of the numerous entities from the Radius.  Audio clues are positional and valuable and you must pay attention to them.  The environment is well-rendered, capturing the desolation and atmosphere of the spooky zone, and the NPC sounds are disturbing, adding a distinct element of horror.  A player will feel the tension increase, and a sense of dread is palpable when progressing into a dangerous area and that is far more intense than many so-called horror games.  Into the Radius reminds us of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with strong feelings of dread and feelings of extreme isolation in a deadly zone.”<br>Recommended – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://babeltechreviews.com/into-the-radius-vr-game-performance-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >BabelTechReviews</a><br><br>“Into The Radius is a great VR survival game with an amazing atmosphere, rewarding experience, and a very interesting set of enemies. It’s especially suited to VR veterans, who may think they’ve experienced all that’s to see and do with the platform. Do beware however, as this game has recently come out of Early Access and has some hallmarks of it.”<br>Good – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/anyone-ask-for-s-t-a-l-k-e-r-vr-into-the-radius-vr-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gaming Trend</a><br>",
