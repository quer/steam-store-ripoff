It exhibits projects originally designed for large-scale immersive environments in a simulation that is true to the physical manifestation of these systems.These systems include 360 degree panoramic and hemispherical projection screens, stereoscopic 3D multi-view installations and a number of spatial and experimental video installations. Situated in a large derelict warehouse, the 3D museum is freely navigable and the many exhibits can be explored interactively. A wide variety of content is accessible, ranging from the arts to research project outcomes.
