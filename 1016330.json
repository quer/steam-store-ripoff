Fight alongside your teammates and allies to capture spawn points.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Alliances</h2>If your team is winning, the other two teams will form an alliance against you. If you're losing, the other losing team will form an alliance with <i>you</i>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Orders</h2>Each team has AI that coordinates the soldiers as a team. Help your team by following your orders… or don't — it's up to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experimental Controls</h2>Bot War uses a completely original system for player controls, that allows you to walk in one direction while looking in another. It takes a bit of getting used to, but you'll soon get the hang of it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Energy Simulation</h2>The more you run, the more tired you'll be, so use your energy wisely, and save it for when you really need it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Slow Bullets</h2>Bullets are slow enough to see and hear as they whizz past your head, but not quite slow enough to avoid… unless you have incredibly good reactions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">One Shot Kills</h2>If one bullet hits you, then you die and respawn, so make sure you don't get hit.",

Dead bodies remain on the ground where they fell for a while before disappearing. When a bullet hits the player, there is a sudden squelch sound, and then the player falls down to the ground, dead. However, there is no blood or gore, or cries of pain, anywhere in the game."
