There is a present ghost epidemic, ghosts have <br />\r\ntaken over several residences and you've been called upon to do the job no <br />\r\none has been able to do, that is eliminate all ghosts you see occupying the <br />\r\nresidences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince these are ghosts, no normal weapon will have an effect on them. You <br />\r\ndo have a weapon that zaps ghosts, a ghost zapper which is basically an EMP <br />\r\ndevice modified by you to zap ghosts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile it all looks good, the zapper has a kink though. It draws on your <br />\r\nenergy when fired. This means that you can't go out there with a guns <br />\r\nblazing mentality in mind. You have to be frugal in your use of the ghost <br />\r\nzapper. So technically, you can kill yourself if you overuse your zapper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe good news is, on successfully zapping a ghost, your health is restored <br />\r\nback to full levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso you have a map that is your guide to tracking down these dastardly <br />\r\nghosts, use it well, make sure you keep your distance when hunting these <br />\r\nghosts, they draw on your health when you get too close to them, even <br />\r\nbehind walls where you can't see. Mastery of your map is essential to your <br />\r\nsurvival in this third person shooter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a ghost, you possess the ability to walk through walls in your bid to <br />\r\nhunt down ghosts, though this process will draw on your health and is not <br />\r\nadvised.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have identified three ghost types out there, the reds are the malevolent <br />\r\ntypes, attacking when you get within range, the yellows which cause <br />\r\ndifficulty with your lights and the blues which teleport you to other areas <br />\r\nwhere you may meet the more malevolent types.
