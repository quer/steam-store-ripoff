            "detailed_description": "The second pack of 9 new in-game music tracks to enhance Flatspace IIk. Like any in-game music for Flatspace, these will trigger at random when you enter a new sector. Three music packs were originally designed for the Flatspace and Flatspace II games, but these were in ogg format and not compatible with the Steam release of Flatspace IIk, so when the time came to re-release the music packs I saw this as an opportunity to revisit the music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original Second Music Pack for Flatspace II was created in 2008, and included lots of game themes from other Cornutopia Games, and tracks from the album Stupid Computer Music, such as China Syndrome. Those tracks were catchy and energetic, but many of those tracks were designed as attention grabbing title music rather than complementary background tracks. When working on this new pack I wanted to compile music that inspired epic feelings of space exploration and excitement, and in the end Journey Through Fractional Space was the only track from that early pack that made it into this new set.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack includes a full description of the music as a pdf booklet. Here is an outline of the music included:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBlue Nebula<br />\r\nCreated in 2012, Blue Nebula is a short music sting that sets something of an epic scene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJourney Through Fractional Space<br />\r\nCommissioned by a Flatspace II player, the brief was to create an action tune that crossed two existing tunes from the first game: Catacombs and Cobra.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPandora<br />\r\nCreated in 2013 for the album Bites of Greatness, the idea for the track was to create a catchy piece of music reminiscent of game themes from the 8-bit era.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRock It 99<br />\r\nI wanted to emulate the feeling of race-game arcade music, and the result was this high energy track.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSonus<br />\r\nThis track paints an ominous picture of a strange electronic world and its relationship with the natural world. The eerie sound here is a perfect evocation of exploring a strange, new frontier, making it ideal for Flatspace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStrange Angles<br />\r\nAn odd time signature for an unusual piece of music inspired by a sculpture and composed for a 2019 album of ekphrastic music, Music of Poetic Objects. I had Philip Glass in the back of my mind while working on this, music for a sculpture of jagged lines and odd angles, like a multi-dimensional snowflake made corporeal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Dark Cliffs<br />\r\nI wanted to include some more expressive, naturalistic music in the pack and The Dark Cliffs is exactly that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Glass Screen<br />\r\nThe Glass Screen is a strange blend of electronic game music and acoustic piano music; music that fades from high excitement into something more gentle and uncertain. The full track includes the following electronic vocals:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTrax<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA high speed, rip-roaring ride of a tune inspired by television game show themes. The full track is on my album of catchy game-like tunes, Bites of Greatness.",
