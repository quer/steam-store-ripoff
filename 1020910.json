            "detailed_description": "The world in War of Gods is divided into many levitating fragments, each of which is unique. There are fragments  completely covered with ice, fragments where the undead reign, and some do not obey either logic or physics at all. The player will have to explore them with his squad, simultaneously pumping various skills and increasing the level of skill. The game has a rich quest system that will give the player an exciting, and most importantly – a diverse experience. Quests in War of Gods go far beyond &quot;go and kill&quot; and &quot;go-bring&quot;. There was a place for logical riddles, detective investigations, and full-fledged military operations. But not all problems in War of Gods are solved with the help of quests. Sometimes the only solution is an old-fashioned fight. Team Games has made every effort to make turn-based battles convenient, exciting, and at the same time moderately difficult. The phrase ‘easy to learn, hard to master’is ideal here. The variety of mechanics and opponents will cause only enthusiasm and involvement, not least thanks to the intuitive and friendly interface. The developers did not forget about the plot. Here it is not for show. The game has a full-fledged epic story, where tragedy and humor are intertwined, scale and personal drama, depth and intrigue. But most importantly, the player can influence the course of the story. So there is enough text- just go ahead! It's time to change the course of the war of the gods.",
