Windowed mode gaming lets gamers instantly switch to other windows in the same computer while they are dead (because they suck) or waiting on loading screens, without having to see Windows go ape nuts when alt-tabbing. Some games even crash when alt-tabbed!<br><br><strong>The app tries to help you be as lazy as possible and do the work for you as much as possible... for free*!</strong> *(Well, after you pay for the app.)<br><br>Extra helpful features are also added to assist gamers when it comes to managing windows on their monitors, such as Ninja Mode where it allows you to hide and mute a window for... um, science!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Automatic Fullscreen Detection</h2>When you run your game on exclusive fullscreen, Magic Borderless can detect it. If this feature is enabled, it will ask you if you wish to apply the borderless magic. When the magic is applied for the first time, all you have to do is set your game to run on windowed mode once. Magic Borderless will take care of the rest automatically every time the game launches. You can also set to apply magic without asking you on new apps.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Improved Borderless Algorithm</h2>There are different ways to make a window borderless, but all of them often has trouble resizing window properly or suffer from graphical errors. Magic Borderless has improved code to combat these issues for you and will work on even more games!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customizable Additional Magic</h2>Besides making your favorite games borderless, you can also set the game to run on a specific window size or simply maximize to your monitor's resolution. If you wish to keep your Taskbar up, you can also toggle it to make sure the window does not hide the Taskbar.<br>Some also prefer their borderless windowed mode to behave like real fullscreen apps (minimize the window on alt-tab). For those weirdos, you can set the Alt+Tab behavior to minimize the window.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ninja Mode: Instant Hide and Mute</h2>By pressing [Alt] + [X], you can activate Ninja Mode on your currently active window. This will not only completely hide them from taskbar and among opened windows, it will also mute that particular window only!<br>This feature is also available to Alt+Tab behaviors for any games you configured!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cursor Lock</h2>Some noob developers forgot to add cursor lock to their games on windowed mode (or they believed it is how they should behave). If you don't like this behavior, no worries! Magic Borderless can lock your cursor to that window OR the monitor (for our beloved multi-monitor users).",
