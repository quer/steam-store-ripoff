            "reviews": "“Very good game with some beautiful graphics. As the title suggests, the main enemy you will be fighting is zombies. But don't let that fool you, this game is much more than mindless zombie slaughter. The second you begin playing this game you embark on a dangerous journey to save the world from zombie infestation, and let me tell you, it is one hell of a ride. This game is an absolute masterpiece and I have been anxiously waiting its release ever since it was originally announced back in 2011. I can not wait to see what is to come for this game, and hopefully series, and look forward to seeing it among all the other AAA titles such as Halo, Red Dead Redemption, Call of Duty, etc. I can not stress enough how good this game is, and if you do not believe me check for yourself, this game will go down in history.”<br />\r\n10/10 – Kyle Guarnieri<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Wow, just wow. This game is definetly one of the best, from the incredible, revolutionary graphics, to the full on intensity. I have over 1000 hours of full on, non stop experience. Let me tell you how this game blows every single other game known to man out of the water. As the head of the Washington Post, founder of BCC, NBC, ABC, Microsoft, Apple, Tmobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon, McDonalds, Carl's Jr, Jack In The Box, Wendys, Burger King, Taco Bell, Dell Taco, Round Table, Marys Pizza Shack, Papa John's Pizza, Papa Murphy's, In N Out, the NBA, the WNBA, UFC, NFL, and the known universe itself, I can asure you this is a must download. Since I am a multi trillionaire, I can guarantee that more than half of my earnings each day will go to this absoloute beast of a game. I don't know why anybody would think I would put my money to charity, a cure for cancer, or the people on the streets when I can put half to the game and half to the wall. Mr.Twoody is a very intelligent Superbeing, who may even god himself, and the creator of every single supercluster and the 3,000,000,000,000 estimated planets. Just know, if you download now you are one of the the lucky participants that can brag about playing a game which will go down in history. Ive done my part in life.. Now do yours, and don't go without reviewing. Thank You.”<br />\r\n10/10 – Ski338lark<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“&quot;One of a king game&quot; Good job. You asset flipped a bunch of store prefabs in unreal engine. Very original. What a fucking joke.﻿”<br />\r\n1000/10 – Achrias<br />\r\n",
