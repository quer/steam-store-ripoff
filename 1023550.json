Rogue Star Rescue is a unique mix of bullet hell roguelite and tower defense games. We've added strong strategy elements to the all-out insanity of bullet hell shooters. The action is smooth, the gameplay is challenging, the story is complex and nonlinear. It's a game you'll get sucked into and will end up spending months exploring the multiple intricacies and outcomes. Keeping the game fun well past the 50-hour mark is our core design focus.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023550/extras/online-couch-coop.gif?t=1602609739\" /><br><strong>Online Co-op! </strong>Games like this are better with friends.
