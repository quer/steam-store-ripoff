That’s why Gun Man is all about offering you ways to protect yourself, but you do need to be quick when it comes to reacting to this. Otherwise you will have challenges and you have to avoid that as much as possible.<br><br><strong>Level puzzles</strong><br><br>Sometimes you will have keys in the levels and these will help you open up the ending of that level. Which is quite nice, because you are always in control and you can have quite a lot of fun in no time. The experience shines for Gun Man just because you have to pass through multiple challenges and avoid traps in order to win.<br>Traps are cleverly added all over the game world.
