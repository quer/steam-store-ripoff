As the Captain frantically gives orders, Engineering nervously warns when shields are down, Sciences notes something unusual about an unidentified ship while Comms reports that this very ship just threatened them.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.outerplaces.com/science-fiction/item/16699-starship-horizons-bridge-simulator-officer-aboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Outer Places</a><br><br>“Of the commercial products we tried, it’s by far the lowest cost per chair and the most technically capable of all the bridge simulator games.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://kryptonradio.com/2017/08/17/event-horizon-bridge-sim-game-starship-horizons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Krypton Radio</a><br><br>“It was a blast!
