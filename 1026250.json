Automatically spawned AI enemies will battle your troops and try to destroy your castles. <br />\r\nDeploy troops like giants, archers and knights to stop and defeat them!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery character has it’s own damage, health and minimal attack distance. This is something to take into account when playing, both attacking and defending, and it is something you should know if you want to win.<br />\r\nCharacters look for the nearest enemy and attack it. Otherwise, if the enemy is out of range, they will attack the castle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can select a unit and deploy it in the battle arena. If you don’t have enough gold to deploy the unit you will have to wait. You receive gold every 5 seconds and by killing enemies as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClick and drag with your mouse to create a rectangle and select troops in the arena. By clicking right mouse button, you can move the selected troops around.",
