In one scene, the player finds another character hanging by her neck from a rope, swaying back and forth. The player never sees a violent act being committed (e.g. you never see someone dying, just the aftermath).\r\n\r\nThough the game got an ESRB descriptor of \"sexual themes,\" these are limited to: allusions to an affair between two characters; one character's confession of possible love for another. No sexual acts are actually depicted. (We've checked \"Sexual content\" here to be honest with the process; we're not sure if what we've described would qualify.)"
