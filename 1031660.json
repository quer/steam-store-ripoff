You can choose who to buy from and who to sell to, as well as the shipping vessel. <br />\r\nBut this is not the whole story: you need to keep your employees happy, take sound financial decisions, watch out for unforeseen troubles and potential game-ending scenarios. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe context plays a decisive role and will impact the success of your company. The macroeconomic and political developments of the single countries affect prices as well as public perception.<br />\r\nRemember, every move that you make, every context-driven event that happens, has an impact on your company and will manifest sooner or later. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose your own path: a greedy profit-centric corporation or a social and environmental conscious company. It all depends on you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMango Cart is a turn-based game: every month you get mandatory tasks to complete and events to check before advancing to the next stage. Additionally, a number of actions are available to you at any time, and a set of external events will pop-up when you least expect them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are several game-ending scenarios but no game-winning target. You can potentially play the game endlessly. At the start of each new year your performance is compared with 4 your competitors: this is where you can check if your company is progressing as expected.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExpect more features, new and enhanced game mechanics with the upcoming releases…<br />\r\n<br />\r\n...and join the community or simply contact AkriGames to suggest new events or things you would like to see added to the game.",
