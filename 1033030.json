MaSzyna shows how unimportant all that out-of-the-window stuff really is. Get the motion, mechanics, and music of trains right, and the auxillary GPU between the user’s ears will do the rest.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/04/14/the-flare-path-get-knotted/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br>",
