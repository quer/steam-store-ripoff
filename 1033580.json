It's built primarily to be replayed, or to simply be enjoyed at any time of the day. It places the focus on unique, momentum-based controls to offer a puzzle game which remains fun to play well after the first playthrough. These puzzles and action sequences take place in a series of rooms and doors which ask the player not only to use their reflexes and puzzle-solving abilities, but also to stretch their navigational muscles here and there. Once you've completed the main game, you can continue to hunt down increasingly more difficult time attack achievements, or try an alternative ship type for a new challenge.",
