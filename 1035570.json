Your standard issue blaster comes outfitted with a single Whiffle ball. If you miss your shot, you better be prepared to slap the competition. Don't worry though, balls tend to show up right when you need them but you will likely need to fight for each one. Try to keep track of who shot their ball, and who has been slapped. It takes 3 slaps to knock someone out, just like in real life. Now get in there and try not to mess this one up!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Whiffle Blasters is a Twin Stick Arena Brawler. Make sure your aim counts because you only have one shot!<br></li><li> Level up your character and unlock new customization items in <strong>online play!</strong><br></li><li> Are you a fan of couch gaming? Of course you are! In <strong>Party Mode</strong> (Local multiplayer only) all the items are unlocked and randomized for your friends to drop in and out at lightning speed. </li></ul>",
