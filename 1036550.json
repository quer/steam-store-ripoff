One of the players controls a character in two-dimensional space, while the other one is operating in virtual reality. <br />\r\nBoth are stationed on a spaceship which has caught fire, they must keep it from burning down. The player who is acting in virtual reality, has to solve puzzles with the help of his partner to extinguish the fire.
