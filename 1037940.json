Equip your warriors with historically inspired equipment and attempt to survive in a dying world overrun by all manner of monsters.<br><br>There are three layers to the game. The &quot;town&quot; layer where you manage the player base, the &quot;map&quot; layer where you traverse the world and take on contracts and the &quot;combat&quot; layer where you engage enemies in turn-based tactical combat. Currently in Early Access, the goal of the game is to hunt down and defeat the 5 Monarchs whilst simultaneously building up your company and upgrading/defending your base.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037940/extras/Dead_Monarchy_Features.jpg?t=1577697483\" ><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[NEW] A multi-region open world map free for the player to traverse.
