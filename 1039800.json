            "detailed_description": "BlueGlow is an arcade like top down shooter. You play as the blues on a mission to destroy the reds as you go through several maps and gamemodes. Utilize 7 guns from your arsenal, all with different traits, to blow through the enemy.<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>The gameplay is very similar to twin stick shooters and arcade shooters as it focuses on being simplistic, using simple point and click shooting. You can pick up weapons, ammo, health, and shields and then you are ready to go.<br><br><strong>Game Modes</strong><br>There are 2 main game modes alongside an extra mode. Red Vs Blue and Survival make up the main game modes. In Red Vs Blue, you have the traditional arcade approach to the game as you battle reds for 2 and a half minutes in small maps. Red Vs Blue is the intended way to play with 5 maps and 3 difficulties. In Survival mode you explore a map 21x the size of the regular maps in Red Vs Blue. There are no teammates and the map is filled with Reds. You have to explore to find all of your guns, ammo, shields, and health and survive. There is no time limit and is meant to be be harder then Red Vs Blue. The extra mode is Arcade. Arcade brings 2 short, unique game modes not tied into the original 2. Infiltration and Room. In Infiltration you have to navigate across a red military base without being spotted. In Room, you have to defend a small room from infinite waves of Reds shooting at it like a tower defense mode.<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong><br>You have access to 7 weapons in your arsenal ranging from pistols to rocket launchers. Snipe reds with the sniper, or run in headfirst with a flamethrower.",
