Now, three months have passed since she started her somewhat special position as a teacher at the &quot;school of assassins&quot;.<br />\r\nWhile she has tried her best to adapt to her new surroundings - and it seems like her students have finally accepted her - her teacher evalution is not quite so agreeable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;She's, uh, unusually modest, and a bit clumsy. But she's sincere, and she tries her best at everything she does...&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;I think she makes a great teacher, but that alone isn't going to keep her at Mihama.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArisaka sees this harsh dose of reality as an opportunity to take an objective look at herself, delving deep the truth through conversations with her students. However, a certain nightmare continues to plague her like an illness...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA girl, whose family has been branded murderers, closes her heart like a cocoon...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I'm so scared...&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;So scared of the outside world.&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;What should I do?&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;How can I convince them to leave me alone?&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;What did I do to deserve this?
