To him, today is just another normal day, but the others can't help but notice that his behaviour seems a bit unusual. Seeing Haruto like this spreads a feeling of unease among the students of class A.<br />\r\nIt's the day when Haruto, along with Sengoku Ichiru, Ukawa Chihiro, and the other members of the first generation of Phantom Triggers go to visit the grave of one of their old friends, located deep in the mountains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere sleeps Haruto's master - Aoi.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe group makes this journey every year, and their car is filled with playful banter at first.
