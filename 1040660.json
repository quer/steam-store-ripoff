She’s barely talking to him and when she does, she usually does it in an insulting or humiliating way, which not really raises his confidence.

But how hopeless the situation might be, they can’t give in. They try to think of some kind of defense plan against the Droons. For that purpose the unequal duo Ramirez and Meling is sent to an abandoned base of the Droons, where they are supposed to search for weapons or other useful stuff. <br><br>With constant tension between them, many awkard situations and in danger of being extinguished at any time, the story begins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters</h2><a href=\"https://partner.steamgames.com/gfxproxy/gfx/apps/1040660/extras/Spielvorstellung_Charaktere_ENG.png?t=1552467389\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >https://partner.steamgames.com/gfxproxy/gfx/apps/1040660/extras/Spielvorstellung_Charaktere_ENG.png?t=1552467389</a><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>completely custom graphics<br></li><li>high quality artworks made in Blender<br></li><li>custom battle system with a lot of variety<br></li><li>custom developing system<br></li><li>support for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android via easyrpg<br></li><li>jumping-system with timing, grab and flip-funktion<br></li><li>custom soundtrack<br></li><li>custom SFX<br></li><li>elaborate cutscenes<br></li><li>panty looting</li></ul>",
