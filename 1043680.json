Normally, you and your enemy wait for speed bar to be fully charged in order to launch an attack (as in other similar game), BUT you can also use a variety of “Unrestricted Skills” even the speed bar is NOT FULL! Such skill has its unique Cooldown time. To make the battle FAR MORE EXCITING, the enemy in later stage WON’T STOP fighting even your speed bar is fully charged! You get certain score by using specific skill to get privilege to purchase certain items with Gold (obtained from killing the enemy) in the store to upgrade your Artifact, Equipment, Attributes, etc., and killing the enemy within certain required rounds will get you bonus Gold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs it is a roguelike game, except for best record you made that will be saved and updated when more gold is obtained based on more stages you have finished, there is no GAME SAVE, which means you have to finish all stages with just one life for the real final victory. You get random active, passive or unrestricted skill when leveling up, encounter random enemy in random sequence with attributes randomly defined in certain range. In some way, the Stun, Critical Strike or other unique passive skills also have chances to be triggered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLast but not least, the final 3 Stages are the most INTERESTING and CHALLENGING throughout the game that you have to experience, but the premise is you can survive to see that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn all, it is an ULTRA test and challenge of your tactics, strategies, reflexes and operations, and I am sure that you have never experienced the same in any other game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWho would be the first one to finish ALL stages?
