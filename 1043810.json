It's still in early development, so everything about it might change!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, combat is about finding clever ways to use your spells to smash your enemies into walls, knock them through windows, or trick them into shooting each other. They're mostly fighting back with guns and grenades, though as the game progresses you'll probably come up against enemy magic users too.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetween fights, we're planning on branching dialogue where you learn more about your team of unique characters and chat about their next objectives. We'd like to also give you some choice of equipment and skills, but no grand strategy layer or base building.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe're imagining it'll be a story driven campaign, maybe 8 hours ish, not a roguelike or permadeath game.",
