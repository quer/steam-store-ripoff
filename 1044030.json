You’ll be taught both character sets in the Learn Mode, along with their Romaji (English character versions) counterpoint and then tested on your progress through Test Mode, where you can gain points (and combo points!) and become fluent as you have fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEverything you do in the game is tracked through the database, which learns your strengths and weaknesses and tailors the game to you, giving priority to characters you’re having trouble with. The database kicks in after you’ve been through both alphabets once. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you score highly in Test Mode, you can unlock the special Advanced Mode which strips away the Romaji and lets you learn Hiragana and Katakana like a native.",
