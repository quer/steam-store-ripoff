It contains detailed written description and low-res pixel-art representation of disturbing scenes. Violence, brutality, harm and mutilation, self-harm, substance abuse, sexual violence, slavery, racism, and hate speech are all a part of the harsh post-apocalyptic reality. The game is recommended for mature audiences."
