Prohibited from simply stopping the fire, you must instead manipulate the choices made by the housemates in the week leading up to it so that they all survive the event.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1046790/extras/Second_Chance_Fire.gif?t=1553077118\" ><br><br>From the outset, you have free and complete reign to explore the seven day timeline before the fire. You can watch and alter the significant events from the entire week as many times as you like and in whatever order you wish. Some decisions will have only minor effects on the timeline, moving objects around the house or revealing deeper stories and secrets. Major changes however, rewrite the timeline by changing existing events, adding new events and even replacing other events entirely.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1046790/extras/Second_Chance_Decision.gif?t=1553077118\" ><br><br>You must traverse up and down this timeline, changing decisions at different moments throughout the week so that their effects interact and combine together to save all six housemates.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1046790/extras/Second_Chance_Timeline.gif?t=1553077118\" ><br><br>However, it is not just the housemates who have choices. Each of them can be saved from the fire in multiple ways, with each outcome having a profound effect on their lives in the future. Will you just search for the quickest and easiest solution, or can you find the best possible outcome for everyone?<br><br>Ultimately, everything is about choices and consequences.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><strong>Choose how you want to follow the game’s story</strong><br>Want to follow each of the six characters’ stories ‘Pulp Fiction’ style? That’s fine. Want to watch the whole thing like ‘Memento’, with the final event first and then moving back in time to see what caused it afterwards? That’s okay too. Or maybe you’re old school and just want to watch things in good-old chronological order? You can do that as well.<br><br><strong>Watch and change things as many times as you like</strong><br>Can’t remember exactly what happened in an event? Changed a decision and you’re not sure you like the consequences? That’s fine. Just pop back along the timeline and watch and change whatever you like, whenever you like, as many times as you like.<br><br><strong>Change the past to affect the future</strong><br>Setting up temporary base in the house mere hours after the fire, provides a unique perspective on events. As you look back through the timeline, past events play out in front of you in ghostly form, with the smoke and fire damaged house a constant reminder of what is to come. In addition, as you manipulate the past, the environment can be reset around you to match the changes taking place. Some new objects will appear, others will move around the house and the contents of rooms can change substantially as you change the past.",
