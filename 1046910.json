Over a 5 year period, a single classroom will spend over $4000 just to dissect frogs. Furthermore, these dissections can only take place once a year and cannot be “redone” if a student makes a mistake.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dissections in VR are a safe alternative</h2>As teachers and parents know, dissections can present a risk to student safety due to: risk of being cut by a scalpel, risk of infection, and exposure to formaldehyde - which can damage the eyes, cause asthma attacks, and bronchitis.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://springboardvr.com?game_verification=5c915830-6211-11e9-b605-835c5fb4deb6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  > Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR </a>",
