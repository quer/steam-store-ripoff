At least, until a shady friend replaces her broken-down housedroid as a favor. Advanced, more efficient and remarkably perceptive, unit M.A.R.A. begins to penetrate Cila's toughened exterior and possibly even heal her new owner's old wounds – if Cila can decipher the recurring nightmare the process brings. Soon Cila and Mara forge a unique - if sometimes uneasy - bond. Unbeknownst to Cila, just as her life begins to find its new normal, the technological giant Velta Labs gets wind of Mara's existence and takes a mysterious interest in the android. A war unlike any before it is brewing on the horizon, its players are silently being selected and one android's fate may spell the difference between peace, war, the blossoming of a new religion, or a technological singularity beyond comprehension.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1047010/extras/Yokostore.jpg?t=1598898448\" /><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Nearly 100 combined, unique backgrounds and CGs<br></li><li> 20+ characters, all with interesting backgrounds and personalities deeply woven into the narrative<br></li><li> An estimated 6-9 hours of gameplay<br></li><li> A unique, vibrant art aesthetic that pervades the neon dystopian setting of the game<br></li><li> A beautiful, vivid soundtrack that complements the game's aesthetic, composed by Andy Andi Han, one of the composers of <i>Katawa Shoujo</i> and <i>Sense: A Cyberpunk Ghost Story</i><br></li><li> Choices that deeply affect the protagonist's journey and world around them, with multiple endings</li></ul><br><i>Currently available in English, Simplified Chinese, and Spanish.
