Players will explore the seemingly endless Trail of Bones, fending off nightmarish threats and encountering other players at random. The game combines meaningful multiplayer interactions with deep roguelike gameplay into a deliciously dark cocktail of adventure, tension and emergent storytelling.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith GUILT, we wanted to explore dynamic multiplayer gameplay within an endlessly replayable procedural dungeon crawl. We want to force players to make tough decisions – whether to escape or explore, whether to co-operate or attack – in an action RPG experience they’ll never forget. We aim to combat the anti-social systems and patterns that are prevalent in many multiplayer games today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGUILT is not a traditional party-based multiplayer RPG, nor is it just another randomly generated hack ‘n’ slash game. You will begin your journey alone, but through our dedicated server matchmaking system you will be paired with other adventurers traveling the same sinister path... Without any knowledge of their personal goals or motives. GUILT features fully open player vs player combat, as well as perma-death and severely limited meta-progression.",
