            "detailed_description": "DeadEye is a classic top-down shooter with stealth, arcade, action and RPG elements. Take control of a single Bionic unit and move him around a hostile territory. You choose whether you want to avoid or fight dozens of enemies, breaking through underground vaults – shape your own playstyle! The game will have difficulty settings, adjust its level to your preferences – play for the story, for the gameplay, for both or push yourself to the limit in hardcore mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main plot</h2>The game allows you to take control of a Bionic which, after a long period of inactivity, has been rebooted. The damage caused to numerous of your systems has certainly been the reason for your shutdown. You quickly notice, however, that someone has made many unauthorized alterations to your body. Unfortunately, your memory chip seems to be defective and apart from few reminiscences, you do not remember much. The place where you are currently located looks like a dump in one of the human vaults. You are shocked by the sound of a message incoming to your TexCom. Reading it makes you realise how an important individual you are.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Prologue</h2>Action of DeadEye takes place in the near future, in which humanity invented its greatest creation – humanoid robots with artificial intelligence called Bionics. But they were far from mindless machines – they had emotions and feelings just like their makers. Humanity, fearing its own invention, limited their freedom with three major principles:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A Bionic may not injure a human,<br></li><li>A Bionic must obey a human’s orders,<br></li><li>A Bionic must protect its own existence.</li></ul><br>Due to these laws, humanity has mastered its fear of the unknown. Bionics had been restricted to an area where they could develop freely. They have established a society without crime and poverty. Bionics thrived and grew exponentially, their technology allowed them to surpass mankind’s peak achievements in a blink of an eye. The success enjoyed by the newly created utopian nation quickly aroused jealousy. The media began spreading rumors about Bionics’ scheme to break the three rules. The turning point in the history of the inhabitants of the earth was called the Juliett incident, named after a human child who was supposedly killed by a Bionic who pushed it in front of a moving car. The fear that lied dormant in people’s hearts resurfaced and quickly turned into hatred. Humanity struck in a flash with an attack orchestrated so well, as if it had been prepared for a long time. The defenseless land of Bionics stood no chance. However, the real terror was yet to come. Remaining countries began to fight for the technology that bionics left behind, which quickly turned into a massacre, a war with no winners. Hundreds of nuclear explosions have sterilised the surface of the earth, and the remnants of humankind have been driven to underground vaults where they curse the day, when Bionics came into existence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interface</h2>Our Bionic carries the Terminal at all times – it is a very convenient tool that every member of its kind has been equipped with. In the following sections, we will briefly discuss its functionalities:<br><br><br><i>BIOTRONIC DATABASE</i><br>It is the equivalent of human memory. Bionics store important facts about their lives in personal databases that are kept on a cutting-edge biotronic chips. Initially, most files of the Bionic that you control are damaged, but they can be gradually restored by collecting memory shards during the playthrough of the game.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/animDatabase.gif?t=1552864252\" ><br><br><i>TEXCOM</i><br>Each Terminal has a TexCom – a kind of an e-mail box.
