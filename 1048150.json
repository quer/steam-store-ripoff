            "detailed_description": "DeadEye is a classic top-down shooter with stealth, arcade, action and RPG elements. In the game, we control a single Bionic unit, avoid or fight dozens of enemies, breaking through underground bunkers. The game will have a division into difficulty levels selected in such a way that you would be satisfied both when you only play for the story, or you love challenges in hardcore mode.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main plot</h2>The game allows you to take control of a Bionic which, after a long period of inactivity, has been rebooted. The damage caused to numerous of your systems has certainly been the reason for your shutdown. You quickly notice, however, that someone has made many unauthorized alterations to your body. Unfortunately, your memory chip seems to be defective and apart from few reminiscences, you do not remember much. The place where you are currently located looks like a dump in one of the human vaults. You are shocked by the sound of a message incoming to your TexCom. Reading it makes you realise how an important individual you are.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Prologue</h2>Action of DeadEye takes place in the near future, in which humanity invented its greatest creation – humanoid robots with artificial intelligence called Bionics. But they were far from mindless machines – they had emotions and feelings just like their makers. Humanity, fearing its own invention, limited their freedom with three major principles:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A Bionic may not injure a human,<br></li><li>A Bionic must obey a human’s orders,<br></li><li>A Bionic must protect its own existence.</li></ul><br>Due to these laws, humanity has mastered its fear of the unknown. Bionics had been restricted to an area where they could develop freely. They have established a society without crime and poverty. Bionics thrived and grew exponentially, their technology allowed them to surpass mankind’s peak achievements in a blink of an eye. The success enjoyed by the newly created utopian nation quickly aroused jealousy. The media began spreading rumors about Bionics’ scheme to break the three rules. The turning point in the history of the inhabitants of the earth was called the Juliett incident, named after a human child who was supposedly killed by a Bionic who pushed it in front of a moving car. The fear that lied dormant in people’s hearts resurfaced and quickly turned into hatred. Humanity struck in a flash with an attack orchestrated so well, as if it had been prepared for a long time. The defenseless land of Bionics stood no chance. However, the real terror was yet to come. Remaining countries began to fight for the technology that bionics left behind, which quickly turned into a massacre, a war with no winners. Hundreds of nuclear explosions have sterilised the surface of the earth, and the remnants of humankind have been driven to underground vaults where they curse the day, when Bionics came into existence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interface</h2>During the game, the Terminal accompanies us all the time – it is a very convenient tool that every Bionic has been equipped with. In the following sections, we will briefly discuss its functionalities:<br><br><br><i>DATABASE</i><br>It is the equivalent of human memory. Bionic stores important facts about its history in its database. Initially, most files are damaged, but you can gradually restore memory during the playthrough of the game.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/animDatabase.gif?t=1552555921\" ><br><br><i>TEXCOM</i><br>Each Terminal has TexCom – a kind of e-mail box. Through it, the player can conduct talks with storyline characters. A very valuable tool for acquiring new knowledge, thanks to which you can make the right decisions.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/texcom.gif?t=1552555921\" ><br><br><i>TRAITS</i><br>The terminal also has the function of improving our Bionic. The player can buy offensive or defensive skills for development kits found during the game. Thanks to this, you can adapt Bionic to your play style.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/traits.gif?t=1552555921\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Environment</h2>Underground bunkers are not only dark nooks and generators of electricity. The player will meet many interactable objects on his way. Sometimes it’s just a button that opens the door, or turns off the light, but there are situations when the player can test his Bionic’s hacking skills during different minigames.<br><br><br><i>CABLES</i><br>Cables is a mini-game in which we take control of the power system in a given region of the bunker. It allows us to plug in and detach different objects from the electricity. Turn off the cameras that look out for us, open the locked door or switch on the disabled computers. All with a few thought-out clicks!<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/cables.gif?t=1552555921\" ><br><br><i>MEMORY</i><br>The goal of the memory mini-game is to remember the arrangement of the green tiles, and then click them all when they are covered. The mistaken clicking of a red tile means starting hacking from scratch. But you must stay vigilant! Time does not stop when hacking – so roaming enemies are still big danger.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/memory.gif?t=1552555921\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat</h2>One of the many elements of the DeadEye game is combat. Although the players bionic has a rifle, it is not very well suited to combat. Skirmishes should be chosen wisely, enemies drawn individually, and preferably player should simply avoid direct clashes.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/shoot.gif?t=1552555921\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2>DeadEye also provides multiplayer online mode for up to four players. The Bionic team can prove themselves in specially prepared cooperation maps, challenges, and PvP modes such as team-deathmatch and capture the flag.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hand-drawn</h2>Each of the objects has its beginning as a sketch on a piece of paper. The drawing goes through many stages before creating the final effect. For comparison, we place a image below that will allow you to compare the first and last stages of production.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/divided2.png?t=1552555921\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2.5 Dimensions</h2>DeadEye combines two approaches. Most of the elements of the environment are textured three-dimensional objects, while the characters are animated frame-by-frame drawings. This combination makes the game, despite its cartoon character, mature artistically.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048150/extras/2_5.png?t=1552555921\" >",
