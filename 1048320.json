He usually likes to collect various video materials, often visiting unfinished construction sites, abandoned hospitals, unknown caves, etc. in the middle of the night. His &quot;Zishan Huomu Vlog&quot; has more than 200,000 fans. This also makes him more and more obsessed. From the beginning, I occasionally explored some urban “forbidden places” and went to the middle of the night to shoot some strange places.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis friend said that he often talks to himself and recites words that others can't understand. Recently, there are strange moves. The most serious one almost dug his eyes with his own hands. Friends who used to be together often gradually stopped contacting. Xiao Li also rented from others to rent an apartment on his own, rarely dealing with people. During the day, the company’s people saw him as a black-eyed look.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the winter of 2018, Xiao Li mysteriously disappeared. According to his friend, the last time he contacted him was to go to the abandoned haunted construction site that night. After 48 hours, the unit reported that the person was missing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat day the police came to his one-bedroom apartment rented in Financial Street. The small room about 20 square meters was very messy. The wall was covered with large-format white paper. The paper was filled with strange symbols with red paint. The investigating police officers were also shocked at first, and the on-site investigation report once described everything that was seen as “this is a neuropathy”. The bed was full of strange books, some were torn and shattered, and some pages were obviously pressed for long periods of time when reading, and the paper had been squashed. There is no other clue in the entire apartment except for the &quot;neuropathy&quot; expressed by the police.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA week later, Xiao Li still had no news, and the police could only file a case for investigation until he found a person or a body. On this day, the landlord came to collect the house and cleaned up the &quot;garbage&quot; left by Xiao Li.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe landlord is a girl, the house is left to her by her father. She usually works in the north, and the house is rented to Xiao Li. On this day, the girl went to work and then cleaned up the room. It was already 11 o'clock in the evening. When the girl finished the room and was about to leave, she suddenly felt that everything in front of her eyes was exceptionally bright. The wooden tables and chairs were all swaying. All the light was as dazzling as the sun. After about 3 seconds, everything returned to normal. The girl felt that it must be I was too tired to go to work during the day, and worked overtime until late, locked the door and went home. At this moment, the girl habitually looked back into the house. The strange thing made the girl return to God for a long time, just in that On the desk commonly used by Xiao Li, there is a diary. The girl clearly remembers that the desk has been cleaned up. There is nothing on the desktop except for a desk lamp. How can a notebook be out of thin air?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCuriosity prompted the girl to sit at the desk and open the notebook. Every page was bloody.
