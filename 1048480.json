Play the story of Spark or create your own levels and share them with the community.<br><br>You are playing as the yellow guy called spark. You wake up at an unknown place which seems to be caught in a loop of time. Your goal is to break the loop by reaching the exit portal in time. But every time the timer runs out the map is reset, and you start again at your spawn portal. Your actions do not go to waste though. A ghost appears and repeats all your moves done previously, interacting with certain elements in the world, effectively allowing you to be at multiple places at the same time. Some elements interact with both, you and your ghosts, while others only seem to exist in one of these dimensions. Use that to your advantage by sending your ghosts to things that you could not accomplish yourself. Break the rules of what seems impossible. But always remember that time is of the essence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Story Mode:</strong><br>Play the story of Spark, lost in space and time.
