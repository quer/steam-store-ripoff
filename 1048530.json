At the time we didn’t know better than letting it control all of our automated work force. A disaster waiting to happen as the AI went rogue.<br><br>In Rise of Humanity you take control of a band of odd heroes who so far have survived the onslaught that started 50 years ago.

This deck gives your characters actions during a mission. Each mission is played out on a hexagonal grid in a strategic turn-based manner.
