The civilization inhabiting the planet are highly advanced, but not able to stop the coming catastrophe that will wipe out their civilization. What we know from historians is that in an effort to save their dying planet, the Iclantians created what is known as Comets.<br><br>The Iclantians crafted these time capsules of rock and ice, mixed with technology, to form pods to launch into space. Once discovered, the pods open to reveal a treasure within. They contain the heritage of their civilization: From technology, to history, toys, art, and even weapons.<br><br>Players find their place in a cluster of suns known as the Rimshot Galaxy. You start in the Remnos system which is home to a variety of alien species. The Remnos system has prospered from the discovery of the comets. <br><br>This is your story...<br><br><strong>Protagonist of your own Story</strong> - Crypterion brings you into the game as it's main character. You can customize more than your hair and eye color. What are your likes and dislikes? Have you had a traumatic past experience which has shaped who you are today? NPC's will recognize these characteristics and respond to them. It's like the character creation system in Conqueror A.D. 1086. We take a streamlined approach and ask you some questions. Crypterion also keeps track of any battle scars or physical appearance changes that happen to you.<br><br><strong>Business Simulation</strong> - Do everything you can to run or ruin your business: Trade in goods, invest in the stock market, go on T.V., participate in auctions, buy and run a small business, fill your treasury to the brim, or spend every penny (cryptos) you earn.<br><br><strong>Story Events</strong> - Most events take place randomly though a card system. During the main story you will come across events that are more elaborate in the way they play out. NPC's will talk with you and you'll be able to build relationships. The conversations will have branches and different abilities can be gleamed from them.<br><br><strong>Officers (Companions)</strong> -Companions are NPC's you meet under unusual circumstances that drive the story forward. It's more appropriate to call these officers companions because of the relationships you build with them. ---- <i>Building a company takes years to accomplish and it will be nice to have someone that shares your burdens, watches your back, and grows along side you. </i><br><br>By learning the laws of business you can succeed.
