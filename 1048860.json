It has a story with the depth of a visual novel filled with many interesting characters and character development. Meet a variety of alien inhabitants from different worlds and amass a fortune. Every time you play, it's different.<br><br>But what is a game about acquiring mass riches if you don't have a way to spend it? Spend your riches on items in the game including: new ships, gifts for companions, technology, trade permits, concept art, auctions, and even planets.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048860/extras/game_details1.png?t=1572978565\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048860/extras/game_details2.png?t=1572978565\" ><br><strong>Your company</strong> starts with a basic cargo ship and a large debt of Cryptos (the default currency) from a loanshark called SpaceBit Holdings. All paths that lead to victory are about you becoming rich through: Cryptos coin market exchanges, trade, commerce, &amp; investments. <br><br><strong>Cargo Ship</strong> - The basics of business include cargo delivery and passengers. There are 4 ship classes: C,B,A, and S. And you'll be able to create a company name.<br><br><strong>Protagonist of your own Story</strong> - Crypterion brings you into the game as it's main character. You can customize more than your hair and eye color. What are your likes and dislikes? Have you had a traumatic past experience which has shaped who you are today? NPC's will recognize these characteristics and respond to them. It's like the character creation system in Conqueror A.D. 1086. We take a streamlined approach and ask you some questions. Crypterion also keeps track of any battle scars or physical appearance changes that happen to you.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048860/extras/question.gif?t=1572978565\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048860/extras/game_details4.png?t=1572978565\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048860/extras/planets_travel.gif?t=1572978565\" ><br><br><strong>Planet details</strong> - It is wise to check if a planet is undergoing a catastrophe before attempting to land. Other details can help direct your business strategy.<br><br><strong>Space Station</strong> - The space station is a specialized area that gives you 4 new areas to explore. You can meet with the Empress (who is the highest galactic power), go to auctions and bid on planet facilities, view a gallery of purchased goods, and have fun with entertainment options. You may even find rare merchants who will only talk to you if you are rich enough.<br><br><strong>Phone calls</strong> - Local authorities may call you from the galaxy map.

NPC's will talk with you and you'll be able to build relationships. The conversations will have branches and different abilities can be gleamed from them.<br><br><strong>Confidence Level</strong> - Success and failure rate for events is not 50/50. As a new captain, you don't have much experience. The more you fail, the faster you learn from your mistakes to increase your success chance.<br><br><strong>Ship Officer</strong> - Once you acquire a ship officer, you'll have the option of letting them handle the encounter for you. Their chance of success may be higher or lower than yours. If you train them well, there abilities may even surpass yours.<br><br><strong>Rare Crew</strong> - If you get lucky, you may encounter a rare crew card.

Companions are NPC's you meet under unusual circumstances that drive the story forward. It's more appropriate to call these officers companions because of the relationships you build with them. ---- <i>Building a company takes years to accomplish and it will be nice to have someone that shares your burdens, watches your back, and grows along side you. </i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Introducing &quot;Astra&quot; </h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1048860/extras/game_details41.png?t=1572978565\" ><br><strong>The Companion System</strong><br>     - Companions have traits &amp; abilities.<br><br>     - They take the lead during events.<br><br>     - They enhance &quot;End Game&quot; content.<br><br>     - Unique story and gameplay elements. (example: unlockable emotions)<br><br><strong>Company Leaders</strong> - Yours is not the only company gaining money and power. Many major players are already well established.
