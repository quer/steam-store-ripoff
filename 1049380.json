While there isn’t much depth to this game other than the easy, medium or hard settings it still held my attention for way longer than I thought it would have. If you like this style of game and looking for something fun to play this is well worth a go and well worth the money.”<br>Score: 80 / 100 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.virtual-reality-shop.co.uk/survivr-castle-defender-steam-vr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The VR Shop</a><br>",
