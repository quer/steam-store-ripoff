Purchase and equip unique and dangerous upgrades from the shop, and send your enemies some torpedoes (or lasers). Subs are falling from the sky and it’s up to you to destroy them. Put your reflexes to the test, using tight yet simple controls to dodge missiles, collect ammo and rack up kills. Verse a range of enemies and bosses and aim for highscore greatness.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UPGRADES AND UNLOCKS GALORE</h2>Fit your sub with powerful upgrades, causing chaos in the water and sky. With 22+ stackable items to purchase, turn your sub into the ultimate killing machine. Satisfy your grinding needs with 25 levels of unlockable content, featuring plenty of varied submarines, game modes, upgrades, and color palettes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHUNKY EXPLOSIONS AND GROOVY JAMS</h2>The rhythm and visual/audio feedback have been a major focus. Each explosion packs a bunch of particles and bits flying everywhere, the menus pop and each element on the game feels alive in a way. The original soundtrack dynamically changes between menus and gameplay situations, adding to each quick and rewarding run.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2 PLAYER CO-OP ACTION</h2>Grab a controller and put your teamwork to the test.
