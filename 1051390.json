Modern interiors, with kitchen appliances, TVs, computer desks and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe collection includes over 50 character sprites, ranging from sci fi soldiers and mechanics to scientists and cyborgs to city police and urban punks. Four new hero characters have fully-animated side-view battlers!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Over 50 new character sprites!<br />\r\n* 12 Modern tilesets!
