Perplexity: Suburban Home is the first in a series of VR escape room games from Trash Dragon Games that was designed for the HTC Vive virtual reality system.  The game has been verified to work with the Oculus Rift Through SteamVR and OpenVR systems.  Rift users must have SteamVR installed and enabled for this game to work.  The game is designed to have simple intuitive controls that should be easy for players of all ages. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an enthusiast of VR escape rooms and escape rooms in general, I have done many different escape room experiences and I tried to find a good balance between being difficult for the sake of being difficult, being too easy, and being more than just a search quest.  Although, you will be searching in this game, that's for sure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI recommend saving experiences like this for when friends are around so everybody can watch on a monitor and give suggestions to the person in the game world, it's a lot of fun to play along.  You can switch the audio from the VR headset to your speakers too.",
