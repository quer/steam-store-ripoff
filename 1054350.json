Your empowered canine senses make you a SUPERHERO. You can hear through walls. You can hear heartbeats speeding up if you're being lied to, or detect people hiding by their breathing. You'll be able to track people and match up items (such as those left at a crime scene!) with the people they belong to. The game's thorough attention to sound design will allow you access to information inaccessible to humans, and it's up to you to make the most of that information. \r\n\r\nYou're out with your owner, having a nice relaxing vacation in the woods when suddenly, due to circumstance you're thrust into the position of scent tracking dog! You take control of this lovely little corgi, utilizing the dog's powerful hearing and scent tracking ability. Your hearing changes depending on where your head is facing - if you look down, you focus on the scent trail, but if you stop walking and look up, you can suddenly hear much further forward in that direction. \r\n\r\nScent is represented by a low, pleasant humming sound on the ground, and like scent tracking in real life, it is INVISIBLE. Picture making your way through a maze, but the walls are removed and the way out is invisible and represented by sound. Due to this unique gameplay mechanic, this game is fully accessible to blind gamers (and they generally seem to excel at playing, moreso than sighted gamers). \r\n\r\nAs you reach goal after goal, you become a kind of privatized K9 tracker, a dog mercenary. Travel to exotic, real-world places like the Australian outback, the American wilderness and the Swiss Alps. In between each mission, you'll have the option to play mini-levels to earn more money to travel to exotic, far-away places: work on a truffle farm, in a hospital to assist with seizure detection and detecting cancer, as an emotional support dog for zoo animals, and many other real world applications of working dogs.",
