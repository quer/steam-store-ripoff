It's simply a really clever, hugely enjoyable game, and it's as much honest tribute as cheeky spoof.”<br>– <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-01-11-cthulhu-saves-the-world-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Eurogamer</a><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t “It's rare to find a game that is both entertaining and genuinely funny, and so far Cthulhu Saves the World is both.”<br>– <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/01/06/xbox-live-indie-gems-cthulhu-saves-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Joystiq</a>",
