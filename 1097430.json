For example, the simulation construction system in “ARK: Survival Evolved”, etc.<br>Because it can't be presented as a perfect form in a short period, the team decides to open the game in a free mode to let players participate in the continuous production and improvement process. The game will have weak internal purchase content, thank you for the understanding and support of all you players.<br>From the beginning of Early Access, we will keep updating every 2-3 weeks.
