For example, the simulation construction system in “ARK: Survival Evolved”, etc.<br>Because it can't be presented as a perfect form in a short period, the team decides to open the game in a free mode to let players participate in the continuous production and improvement process. The game will have weak internal purchase content, thank you for the understanding and support of all you players.<br>From the beginning of Early Access, we will keep updating every 2-3 weeks. We hope that we can steadily add content to the game for 3 years or even longer, because this is a business mode that supports our pursuit: stable updates bring healthy consumption mentality and endless joy to the players, pleasant players recommend the game to their friends, and new players continually join the game, which provide us with the fund to perfect the game.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1097430/extras/Honeycam_2020-04-23_13-24-44.gif?t=1599031614\" /><br>Collect heroes, develop kingdoms, and explore one of the most in-depth idle RPG ever!<br>You can call heroes to form a team, and lead the army against the ancient evils on the mainland, develop your own camp into your empire, and finally explore the hidden secrets behind this disaster world.<br>Even if not online, you can earn resources.
