The result is Shadowgrounds Survivor, and it's every bit as good as the first release. Survivor, the extended remix of Shadowgrounds, is a must-have for any fans of action-horror.&quot;<br><br>- Worthplaying - 89% (<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=49020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >full review</a>)<br><br>&quot;FrozenByte definitely has a winner on its hand. If you have the hankering to play an action top down shooter that looks good and has addictive gameplay, look no further than Shadowgrounds: Survivor.&quot;<br><br>- GamingTrend - 89% (<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamingtrend.com/Reviews/review/review.php?ReviewID=971\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >full review</a>)<br><br>&quot;I don't know of any other top-down shooters for the PC which are done as well, or look as good or cost $20.  You also receive the tools to completely mod the game and create additional maps.  Generally my rule is that if I feel like replaying a game right after I finish it, that's a good enough indication of its worth, and Survivor is definitely worth it.&quot;<br><br>- 2024 - 85% (<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.2404.org/reviews/2745/Shadowgrounds-Survivor-Review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >full review</a>)",
