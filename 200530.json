As a result, more RAM is made available for MAGIX Movie Edit Pro 2013 Plus. More memory for adding images and graphics to the clipboard (so-called &quot;bitmap caching&quot;) ensures noticeably smoother playback.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Improvements</h2><br>Now even faster: Quicker loading times, enhanced performance and improved output options!<br>Our developers worked hard at making the new version even faster and more efficient, and they were successful! The AVCHD file import feature has been improved and is now more than 40% faster*. Rendering test projects (AVCHD Full HD) with Intel® Quick Sync Video, AMD®/OpenCL™ or NVIDIA® CUDA™ for the Apple iPad is now up to twice as fast in Movie Edit Pro 2013 Plus*.
