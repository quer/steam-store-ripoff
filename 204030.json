Create your life story from childhood to death. Grow from an inexperienced adolescent into the most powerful being in the world. Choose the path of righteousness or dedicate your life to evil. Muscles expand with each feat of strength. Force of will increases with each work of wit. Obesity follows gluttony, and skin tans with exposure to sunlight and bleaches bone-white by moonlight. Earn scars in battle and lines of experience with age. Each person you aid, each flower you crush, and each creature you slay will change this world forever.

Skulk in the shadows, and watch your skin bleach. <br>\t\t\t\t</li><li>Engage in intense real-time combat: Collect battle scars as you duel with a world of cunning foes and deadly creatures.
