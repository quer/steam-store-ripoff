They discover a creepy cabin in the woods(TM) and decide to call a helicopter. Whilst summoning the helicopter, they accidentally summoned the evil forces of hell as well! Fend of hordes of zombies while keeping the generator running, powering the lights and the signal to the helicopter. It wouldn't be a FL map without our signature humour so expect some unusual zombies, crazy environments, a ton of destructables, easter eggs and buckets of GORE.
