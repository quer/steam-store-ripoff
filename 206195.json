For hopefully obvious reasons, we can't give technical support for these.<br></li><li><strong>Exclusive Music Tracks:</strong> Bonus pieces produced specially by Gunpoint's composers for this edition, mixing the game's noir style with electronic influences. Since they're not used as background music in the game, our composers took the chance to be more adventurous with these tracks.<br></li><li><strong>The Secret Beta Access List (betas may be Windows only):</strong> adds an option in the game menu to sign up to our Secret Beta Access List.
