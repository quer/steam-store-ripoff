Together, the world’s most hilarious team of heroes will need to restore peace to the Glade, or watch as their beloved home vanishes like a bad dream...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Rebirth of a Platforming Legend:</strong> It’s been 15 years since the initial launch of Rayman.  Rayman Origins brings back many of the classic characters, revived in their original 2D form, as well as a whole new world of characters and environments.  <br></li><li><strong>Four-Player, Jump-In/Jump-Out, Co-op Gameplay:</strong> Play as Rayman in the solo campaign, or have up to three friends jump in at any time to play as Globox or as one of the two Teensies.

A possessed, mountainous golem...  An evil daisy-cum-carnivorous plant...Rayman Origins will put players to the test with these and many more challenging boss battles!<br></li><li><strong>A Handful of Highly Talented Artists and Engineers:</strong> Rayman Origins was developed by the UBIart team in Montpellier and is built on an open-source game engine - the UBIart Framework - designed by Michel Ancel to allow much smaller teams of artists and developers to produce incredibly high-quality graphics and gameplay quickly and efficiently.
