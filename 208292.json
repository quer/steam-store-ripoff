It may sound simple, but the design required a number of complex technical solutions: the oil-fired firebox was mounted at the leading end of the boiler, so it was supplied with oil via low-pressure pipework running all the way from the rear tender. <br><br>The Cab Forward for Train Simulator represents the (Articulated Consolidation) AC-10, AC-11 and AC-12 types.
