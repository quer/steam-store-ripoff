York eventually became the headquarters for the entire line, its impressive station and enormous 295-lever signal box (the largest manual signal box in Britain) imprinting the city in history as one of the country’s most important railway centres. The world speed record for steam locomotives was set on the line at Stoke Bank back in 1938, and in the late 20th Century much of the ECML was relayed for modern high speed running, beginning with the fearsome Deltic locomotives and continuing with the ubiquitous HST sets which still operate today. The East Coast Main Line for Train Simulator recreates the fast, open stretch from Newcastle to York as it appeared in the late 1970s, and includes a selection of British Rail diesel locomotives with rolling stock and plenty of scenarios to test your driving skills.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>East Coast Main Line from Newcastle to York via Durham and Darlington<br></li><li>Class 55 ‘Deltic’ diesel locomotive in BR Blue and BR Green liveries<br></li><li>Class 47 diesel locomotive in BR Blue livery<br></li><li>Class 43 HST high speed train in BR Blue/Grey </li></ul><strong>Please note: if you have already purchased RailWorks or Train Simulator 2012, you already have this route and its contents. </strong>",
