The set can reach 140 mph, whilst featuring tilting train technology to allow higher speeds around bends. At present, the Class 390 operates along the West Coast Main Line and is well-known to commuters and railfans alike for its sleek looks and high performance. In 2006 a Class 390 set a new speed record along the West Coast Main Line, completing the 401-mile trip from London to Glasgow in 3 hours and 55 minutes, and in usual operation the sets will run up to 125mph where track conditions allow.
