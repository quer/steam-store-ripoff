In 1938, the SP&amp;S took delivery of three Baldwin Locomotive Works 4-8-4 locomotives, numbered 700, 701 and 702. These locomotives, designated as E-1 Class ‘ Northerns’, were identical in design to the Northern Pacific A-3, except that they burned oil instead of coal.<br><br>The ‘Northerns’ operated at a tractive effort of 69,800 lbf (310.49kN) and included a Walschaerts valve gear, piston valves and two cylinders. On entering service, they operated the SP&amp;S’ premier passenger services, including the Empire Builder, although by the late 1940s had been moved to secondary passenger services due to the introduction of diesel locomotives and by the mid-1950s were relegated to freight services.<br><br>By Summer 1956, all three ‘Northerns’ had been retired from service, with No. 700 pulling its last passenger train from Portland, Oregon to Wishram, Washington on 20th May 1956.
