Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Beautifully modelled with highly accurate controls and cab features, the 56xx tank locomotive is one of the most realistic steam driving experiences available for Train Simulator.<br><br>The origins of the 56xx Class locomotive lie among the coal mines of South Wales, where the 0-6-2 locomotive configuration was proved to handle the tightly-curved lines with ease. Following the 1922 grouping of numerous small railways into large companies, the Great Western Railway gained the railways of South Wales, including their proven but ageing R and M Class tank locos.<br><br>Having condemned many of the original locomotives as past their working lives, the Great Western set about replacing them and the 5600 class (or 56xx) was born. They proved to be powerful machines capable of hauling 40 wagons or more, though there were some concerns about stability when hauling passenger stock. Introduced in the 1920s, the 56xx soldiered on through the Second World War and into the 1960s, proving itself a tough and versatile locomotive. In total, 200 were built, early versions having tapered buffers rather than the parallel buffers of later examples, and nine survive in preservation today.<br><br>The 56xx Class for Train Simulator, developed by Peter Gillam, is available in three control modes and a variety of liveries, including Great Western Railway ‘Shirt Button’ and large logo variants, and pre and post 1956 BR liveries. The main features of the locomotive include cylinder cocks with prototypical operation and dynamic cylinder cock steam, ejector operated brake vacuum creation including leakage management, feathered safety valves, dynamic smoke effects, notched reverser, operational reverser locking lever, steam leak effects when stationary, mason's valve and steam heating valve affect the heating system pressure gauge, custom head code lamps which can be set from the cab, operational water tank gauge, dual chime whistle with working in-cab chains and external steam blasts, plus operable front and rear windows, doors, seats and roof and window panels.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the GWR 56xx Class on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/208294\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >’Memories of Maerdy’</a> route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Five scenarios for the Memories of Maerdy route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tAn Introduction to the 56xx<br></li><li>\tCoals to Wales Part 1<br></li><li>\tCoals to Wales Part 2<br></li><li>\tSeparate the Sheep from the Goats<br></li><li>\tWet Wednesday</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
