            "detailed_description": "The ICE 1 is a ground-breaking German high-speed train which delivers real performance for drivers around the world in Train Simulator. <br><br>The InterCity-Express, or ICE, was introduced by Deutsche Bahn in 1991 to run high-speed passenger services across a broad network linking such German cities as Frankfurt, Mannheim, Hamburg and Dusseldorf. With a top speed of 186mph (300kph), the ICE was a huge leap forward for passengers with journey times being reduced significantly. With 14 cars per set, these 410-metre long trains have been produced in 5 different versions since their introduction, with the later ICE –T and ICE-TD featuring tilting technology for faster cornering. However, the original ICE-1 sets have now been refurbished to include more refined interior fittings and electric power sockets for the passengers. All are air-conditioned and include special on-board boosters to improve mobile/cell phone reception while travelling. The ICE for Train Simulator recreates the original ICE-1 series of trains introduced in 1991 and includes accurate controls (including automatic drive and brake system), passenger view, moveable cab blinds and more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Includes:</h2><br>German ICE Express Train with accurate controls including automatic drive and brake system and move-able cab blinds<br><br>Scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
