Long handle. Long blade. Good for reaping corn, wheat - or shambling monsters. A great new toy for the Berserkers amongst you - or for those with a Grim Reaper fetish.\n<li><strong>Tommy Gun:</strong> The Thompson sub-machine gun is an absolute classic of design and functionality, beloved by soldiers and gangsters for decades! A great favorite with the British Commandos in WWII that should become a firm favorite with Commandos in game too.\n<li><strong>Flare revolver:</strong> A classic wild west revolver modified to shoot fireballs! Grab two of them for twice the fun. What Firebug wouldn't want this addition to his arsenal? \n<li><strong>Buzzsaw Bow:</strong> A crossbow modified to shoot spinning saw blades sounds insane, and it is. That's why we gave this weapon to the Berserker. Just watch that little blade of death bounce around!</ul>\n",
