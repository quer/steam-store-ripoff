And you can only let 200 of them die - just how long can you last in this mode&gt; And how big will your score get!?<br></li><li><strong>Dark Mode</strong> - if the standard Arcade mode is not enough of a challenge for you (or you just want life for your Dwarfs to be a little bit more scary) then play this mode. In this mode, the unexplored sections of the map are ALL dark - nothing is marked for you. Send your dwarfs forth to explore and collect gold and loot. Or die.
