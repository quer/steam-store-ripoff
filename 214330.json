With limited money available, all cash will be fiercely fought over as no money can be deposited in &quot;Topscorer.&quot;  As you frantically collect as much cash as possible, the player with the most money will trigger a timer of 60 seconds and the countdown begins!  You must hold your nerve, defend your monopoly and fight off the attackers until the timer reaches 0 to win the match.  Should another player collect more money than the current winner while the timer is still counting down, the clock will reset, but with 2 seconds less on each occasion, until the maximum countdown time is just 20 seconds.
