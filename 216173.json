Carbon Games approached Bill Leeb with this project because the rich layers of FLA's songs seemed like a perfect fit for dynamic music for AirMech. After a yearlong collaboration, the resulting instrumental tracks covered a wide range of styles and explored new ground for the band.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe resulting music exceeded everyone's expectations. We are excited to be able to offer this full studio album--the same as you can find in retail stores--here on Steam!
