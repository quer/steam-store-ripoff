Because you want to open your eyes and be up to your waist in seawater, to walk to shore and wander through fields that sing. And that’s an itch only Proteus can scratch.”<br> 8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.edge-online.com/review/proteus-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Edge</a><br><br>“I come away from it feeling elated.
