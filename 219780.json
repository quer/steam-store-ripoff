It's been a long time since I've played an RPG that manages to balance a lengthy, in-depth story with such a self-aware and hilarious script”<br>– <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.incgamers.com/2010/11/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >IncGamers</a><br><br>“The writing is consistently terrific, from the genuinely creative quests with multiple solutions to the NPCs which are all hand-crafted and infused with personality. Where other games would have copy + pasted Unclickable Villager A and B a few dozen times, Divinity 2 gives you an actual village, complete with gossipers, philanderers, military deserters, the occasional secret murderer, and even a few normal people”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.somethingawful.com/d/video-game-article/dragon-knight-saga.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >SomethingAwful</a><br><br>“It's amazing such a good game remained undiscovered until this &quot;remastered&quot; version was released. (...) The quests are surprisingly good, with charming voicework and a great sense of humour - and then there's the exploration, with hidden caverns and keys rewarding diligent players”<br> – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.rpgwatch.com/show/article?articleid=168\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >RPGWatch</a>",
