The latest, Nancy Drew: The Deadly Device, is the 27th installment in this award-winning series of games playable on computers. And this time detective Nancy Drew uses science to help her to solve a mysterious death… The developer does a great job of combining real science with a compelling mystery.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/gudmundsen/2013/01/11/kid-tech-nancy-drew-deadly-device/1818223/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >USA TODAY</a><br><br>“NANCY DREW: THE DEADLY DEVICE is a fantastic adventure game with interesting characters and an intriguing mystery to solve. Kids can learn a great deal about electricity, and in particular the life and work of Nikola Tesla. The storyline also raises thought-provoking issues about scientific research, such as the potentially disastrous consequences of certain discoveries falling into the “wrong” hands. With two difficulty levels to choose from, The Deadly Device will appeal to amateur sleuths young and old — including parents. This is a great game for daughters to play with a mom or grandmother.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/nancy-drew-the-deadly-device\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Common Sense Media</a><br><br>“The Nancy Drew series has matured with each new release and we can see why it has come so far. In the 27th outing, you get to play the role of the famous female sleuth Nancy Drew once again, meet and interview colorful characters, switch between night and day in an innovative way, explore a cool looking high tech laboratory, read up on Tesla and electronics, play with interesting equipment, try out new mini-games in your cell phone, call the Hardy Boys and Deirdre for advice, recover yourself with Second Chances, and solve challenging puzzles.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://buzz.gameswarp.com/game-review/nancy-drew-the-deadly-device/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamesWarp</a><br>",
