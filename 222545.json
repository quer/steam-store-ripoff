Its main purpose was to enable smaller train units to be built which could be coupled to or uncoupled from other units as needed. The resulting ICE 2 featured one power car, six passenger cars and an unpowered cab car with a top speed of 174mph (280km/h), instead of two power cars and up to 14 passenger cars as was the consist of the ICE 1.<br><br>The ICE 2 is similar in appearance externally to the ICE 1 but an airline-style seating arrangement provides enhanced passenger accommodation over its predecessor. The ICE trains are also fitted with a high standard of technology, including audio jacks for on-board music and radio, full air conditioning and some seats benefiting from seat-back video displays.<br><br>In total, more than 40 eight-car units have been built and each has passenger capacity for almost 400 people. The ICE 2 mainly operates within Germany with some units licensed to run in Austria and Switzerland.<br><br>The ICE 2 for Train Simulator is available in Deutsche Bahn white and red livery, and features a fully detailed cab and internal control panel, functioning AFB, PZB and LZB systems, in cab lighting and TSX standard features. It is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the ICE 2 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
