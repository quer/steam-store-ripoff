The first 4BIG was delivered into service in late 1965 from BR York Works, and up until 1972 were regular units on south coast passenger services.<br><br><br>The fleet of 4BIGs lasted more than 40 years in service, initially on Brighton line services, later on the Waterloo to Portsmouth route and eventually across the Southern network. Following privatisation of the UK railway network, 4 BIGs were operated by Connex South Central up until 1997 when some were transferred to South West Trains. The redundant units were refurbished and re-allocated to other EMU classes.
