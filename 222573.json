Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The Electro-Motive GP20 was designed to satisfy the railroads’ 1960s demands for ever-more horsepower. In a production run lasting from November 1959 to April 1962, the EMD GP20 came to symbolize both the beginnings of the “second generation” of North American dieselization and the “horsepower race” of the early 1960s.<br><br>The GP20 was the first of EMD’s long line of successful “Geeps” to be turbocharged, providing the locomotive with 2,000 horsepower. A total of 260 GP20s were constructed for seven U. S. railroads – and the first buyer of the landmark locomotive was the Western Pacific.<br><br>Western Pacific’s GP20s were built with high noses (a design that had been the norm in the 1950s but would soon be replaced by a short front hood offering enhanced visibility). The units were equipped with dual controls for ease of bi-directional use, weighed 257,000 pounds, and were dressed in Western Pacific’s attractive and iconic “Zephyr” silver and orange livery. <br><br>WP utilized its GP20s system-wide use, frequently calling upon the versatile diesels to tote heavy or priority tonnage through the rugged Feather River Canyon. Most of Western Pacific’s GP20s remained in service until WP was merged into Union Pacific in 1982, and in 1985 Union Pacific donated Western Pacific 2001 – the first GP20 built – to the Feather River Rail Society and the diesel is today preserved at the Western Pacific Railroad Museum in Portola, California.<br><br>Developed by Reppo, the Western Pacific GP20 for Train Simulator features a range of advanced operating features, including authentic start-up procedures and highly realistic operating controls, and a detailed cab interior with dual, bi-directional engineer control stands. <br><br>The locomotive also is Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Western Pacific GP20 High Nose on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/376932\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Feather River Canyon</a> route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Four scenarios for the Feather River Canyon route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Canyon Works Part 1<br></li><li>Canyon Works Part 2<br></li><li>Lumberjill Part 1<br></li><li>Lumberjill Part 2</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
