Initially, the three-car units were constructed from steel, before being built using aluminium, making the cars more lightweight and capable of carrying a heavier payload.<br><br>A top speed of 120 km/h (75mph) and quick acceleration made these units ideal for the commuter stopping services in Germany’s larger cities, however the class’ retirement saw many units scrapped, although some have survived and still operate on the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn network.<br><br>The BR 420 for Train Simulator, developed by Michael Fruchtl, is available in Deutsche Bahn’s distinctive red and white livery and features combined throttle and brake control, SIFA driver vigilance device, PZB warning system, operating sun visors, cab and desk lighting, automatic couplings, and configurable destination displays.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DB BR 420 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
