Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The Gresley-designed Class J50 from Meshtools is now available for Train Simulator in a number of BR and LNER liveries.<br><br>The origins of the Class J50 were in the Sir Nigel Gresley-designed Class J23, an 0-6-0T steam locomotive designed in 1913 for the purpose of working short-haul coal traffic in Yorkshire. Forty Class J23s were built for the Great Northern Railway (GNR) between 1913 and 1922 and proved to be an adaptable locomotive in the compact coal yards of the North.<br><br>At the time of Grouping in 1923, the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) adopted the Class J23 and reclassified it as the J50 and J51 – the former with larger boilers and the J51 with smaller boilers. The LNER continued to build a further 62 Class J50s between 1924 and 1939, and rebuilt its Class J51s to Class J50s between 1929 and 1935.<br>Four subdivisions of the Class J50 distinguished variations during construction, including the fitting of steam or vacuum brakes, left or right-hand drive and long or short coal bunkers. With the nationalisation of Britain’s railway network, British Railways inherited the LNER Class J50s, and they continued in service as shunting and short-haul locomotives.<br><br>Withdrawal of the Class began in September 1958 at the arrival of diesel shunters, and all regular locomotives were withdrawn by September 1963, leaving just departmental locomotives in service. These were subsequently withdrawn by September 1965.<br><br>The Class J50 for Train Simulator, developed by Meshtools, is available in a number of British Railways and LNER  liveries, including BR Green, BR Early, BR Late, BR Mid, LNER Black and LNER Green. Features of the locomotive include standard and advanced driving controls, with extra scripting on the advanced controls to depict vacuum brakes, dampers, notched reverser, exterior animations and controller emitters.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR/LNER Class J50 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/222554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Western Lines of Scotland</a> route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Three scenarios for the Western Lines of Scotland route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tGetting to Know the Locals<br></li><li>\tOn Tour<br></li><li>\tReplacement Service</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
