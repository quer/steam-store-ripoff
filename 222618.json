It forms a key artery on the eastern side of the UK and broadly runs parallel to the A1 trunk road.

Significant landmarks along the route also include the striking Alexandra Palace, the Emirates Stadium (home to Arsenal Football Club), Digswell Viaduct, Gasworks Tunnel at King’s Cross, Copenhagen Tunnels, Bounds Green train maintenance depot, and Peterborough’s large freight yard and Post Office depot.<br><br>Also included with the route is the popular High Speed Train, complete with Class 43 locomotives and full coach consist, and the commuter Class 365 EMU in First Capital Connect livery, a train which is seen on outer-suburban services between London, Peterborough and beyond.<br><br>Whether you are looking for high speed running or the more serene stopping commuter services along the route of the famous Flying Scotsman, the East Coast Main Line London-Peterborough route for Train Simulator is filled with challenging drives and magnificent scenery across the UK’s capital and Home Counties.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Twelve Scenarios For the Route</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tPeterborough Nene Sidings Departure Tutorial<br></li><li>\tKing’s Cross Empty Stock Tutorial<br></li><li>\tPeterborough Southbound Stopper<br></li><li>\tNorth to Hitchin<br></li><li>\tWelwyn Garden City – Down Slow from London (Part 1)<br></li><li>\tWelwyn Garden City – Back Up to London (Part 2)<br></li><li>\tBack to Bounds Green<br></li><li>\tThe Staff Train<br></li><li>\tIn a Hurry<br></li><li>\tMorning commute to Stevenage<br></li><li>\tSouthbound to Kings Cross<br></li><li>\tThe 801 at 08:01</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
