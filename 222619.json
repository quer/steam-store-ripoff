Given an 'X' suffix for 'eXperimental', the DDA40X (re-designated DD40X by the Union Pacific Railroad) was introduced not only to haul heavy freight trains, but also to act as a test bed for new systems which would soon be found on other EMD locomotives. Externally, the most obvious new design was the full-width or ‘Comfort’ cab, which became commonplace across the EMD range.
