Much of the engineering was derived from research and operational experience garnered during development of the APT.<br><br>Given the auxiliary name of <i>InterCity 225</i>, a nod to their designed operating speed of 225 km/h (140mph), the Class 91 exclusively works flagship high speed passenger services on the East Coast Main Line between London King’s Cross and Edinburgh Waverley, leading a rake of nine Mk4 passenger coaches and a Mk4 DVT. Realistically, services only run at 125mph (201 km/h) due to the track infrastructure, but occasionally do reach their designed top speed to make up time.<br><br>The Class 91 for Train Simulator is available in InterCity Swallow livery as carried between 1988 and 1996, and features two fully working driving cabs, complete with DRA, AWS and vigilance device reset, and cruise control. The Mk4 DVT also includes a fully driveable cab, giving complete push-pull capabilities to the train.
