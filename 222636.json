Its 3,250 horsepower output enabled a top speed of 80mph (129 km/h), and the ‘Grids’ plied its trade across the British railway network at the head of heavy freight services.<br><br>Following privatisation of the rail network in 1996, many models passed to private owners. However, maintenance needs were high by modern standards, and notwithstanding significant investment by private operators, the class could not compete with more modern Class 66 in terms of availability or maintenance costs.<br><br>Most locomotives were withdrawn by EWS on 31 March 2004, although some were reinstated for use on construction trains connected with the LGV East in France; others were put into service for private operators such as Fastline and Colas Rail, and remain in service today.<br><br>The BR Sectors Class 56 for Train Simulator is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to Train Simulator standard, including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling. Features include cab and instrument lighting, two-tone horn, driver vigilance device, engine shut down/start up procedure and slow speed control.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR Sectors Class 56 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
