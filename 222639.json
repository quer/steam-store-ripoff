Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The TRAXX series of electric locomotives from Bombardier is responsible for many of Germany’s more modern freight and passenger locomotives, including the BR 145, now available for Train Simulator.<br><br>The mainline BR 145 was derived from the prototype locomotive 128 001, built by AEG and Henschel as an experimental high-performance electric locomotive as a test bed for new technology. This prototype paved the way for an order of 80 BR 145 locomotives in 1997 by Deutsche Bahn AG, specifically for medium-weight freight operations on the German rail network.<br><br>In 2000 a derivative locomotive, the BR 146, was developed specifically for passenger services, adapted for higher speed running; however, over time the BR 145 was also pressed in passenger service, albeit with a top speed of 140 km/h (87mph) but equally capable of hauling local Regio passenger trains.<br><br>The BR 145 for Train Simulator is available in Deutsche Bahn ‘Traffic Red’ livery as it can be seen hauling passenger services across Germany. The locomotive is fitted with PZB, AFB and SIFA in-cab signalling and driver safety devices, alongside Eurofima passenger coaches.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DB BR 145 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/222588\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Hamburg-Hanover</a> and <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/277768\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >The Rhine Railway: Mannheim - Karlsruhe</a> routes (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2>Four scenarios for the Hamburg-Hanover route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tSimple Controls Training: DB BR 145<br></li><li>\tExpert Controls Training: DB BR 145<br></li><li>\tIt’s Snow Trouble<br></li><li>\tNorthbound Passenger</li></ul><br>Three scenarios for The Rhine Railway: Mannheim - Karlsruhe route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Karlsruhe Express<br></li><li>Race Day Special: Part 1<br></li><li>Race Day Special: Part 2</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
