Despite all the insanity around the concept – and aside from all the weird &quot;challenge mode&quot; variants, unlockable ships, cute level descriptions, and all the other quirk – Retro/Grade is a well-designed music game with a completely original soundtrack.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/08/21/retro-grade-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Joystiq</a><br><br>“The game has the feel of something that was much-loved and fussed over. There is no aspect of the game that isn’t fun to look it or read, and that level of dedication goes a long way to helping the game stand out in a crowded marketplace.”<br> – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/retro-grade-is-a-pulpy-sci-fi-rhythm-game-shooter-that-moves-backwards-in-t\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Penny Arcade</a><br><br>“Until now, Amplitude has been without a doubt my favorite music game, ever. Retro/Grade scratches that very same itch, but its unique marriage of high-concept premise and classic rhythm gameplay make it an all-around more satisfying experience”<br>10/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/reviews/article/retrograde-review-for-ps3.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Thunderbolt Games</a>",
