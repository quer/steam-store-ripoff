We have also released the source code for the server which helps the Perpetuum community in further development and bug fixing.<br><br>For more information on the standalone server, see our announcements <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://blog.perpetuum-online.com/posts/2018-01-09-2018-status-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >here</a> and <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://blog.perpetuum-online.com/posts/2017-09-03-perpetuum-is-dead-long-live-perpetuum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >here</a> and take a look at the <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/app/223410/discussions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >discussion forums</a> for more details on the community projects.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Perpetuum is a persistent, sandbox, single server, massively multiplayer sci-fi rpg (MMORPG).
