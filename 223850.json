With its wide range of benchmarks, you can test everything from tablets and notebooks to the latest 4K gaming PCs.<br><br>3DMark is for gamers, overclockers and system builders who want to get the most out of their hardware. When you buy 3DMark on Steam you unlock all the tests, settings, and features in 3DMark Advanced Edition.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Better benchmarking with 3DMark</h2><br><strong>The right test every time</strong><br>We've made it easy to find the right test for your PC. 3DMark automatically scans your hardware and recommends the best benchmark for your system.<br><br><strong>Choose your tests</strong><br>3DMark grows bigger every year with new tests. When you buy 3DMark from Steam, you can choose to install only the tests you need.<br><br><strong>Hardware monitoring</strong><br>Detailed charts show you how the CPU and GPU temperatures, clock speeds, and the frame rate changed during your benchmark run.<br><br><strong>Custom settings</strong><br>Explore your PC's performance limits with custom benchmark settings. Make the tests more or less demanding by changing the resolution and other settings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DirectX 12 Benchmark Tests</h2><br><strong>Time Spy - DirectX 12 benchmarks for Windows 10 PCs</strong><br>With its pure DirectX 12 engine, Time Spy is the ideal benchmark for testing the DirectX 12 performance of modern gaming PCs. Time Spy Extreme, the world’s first 4K DirectX 12 benchmark test, is perfect for benchmarking the latest high-end graphics cards and new processors with 8 or more cores.<br><br><strong>Night Raid - DirectX 12 test for integrated graphics</strong><br>Night Raid is a DirectX 12 benchmark for testing and comparing PCs with integrated graphics and Always Connected PCs powered by Windows 10 on ARM. This is an ideal test for laptops, notebooks, tablets and other mobile computing devices. <br><br><strong>Port Royal - Real-time ray tracing benchmark</strong><br>3DMark Port Royal is the world’s first real-time ray tracing benchmark for gamers. Use Port Royal to test and compare the real-time ray tracing performance of graphics cards that support Microsoft DirectX Raytracing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DirectX 11 Benchmark Tests</h2><br><strong>Fire Strike - For high-performance gaming PCs</strong><br>Fire Strike is a showcase DirectX 11 benchmark designed for high-performance gaming PCs. Use Fire Strike to test dedicated gaming PCs, Fire Strike Extreme for high-end systems with multiple GPUs (Crossfire/SLI), or see if your PC is ready for 4K gaming with Fire Strike Ultra. <br><br><strong>Sky Diver - For gaming laptops and mid-range PCs</strong><br>Sky Diver is a DirectX 11 benchmark that is ideal for testing mainstream graphics cards, mobile GPUs, integrated graphics and other systems that cannot achieve double-digit frame rates in the more demanding Fire Strike test.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DirectX Legacy Benchmark Tests</h2>Use Cloud Gate to test the performance of older notebooks and home PCs with DirectX 10 compatible hardware. Use Ice Storm and Ice Storm Extreme to compare DirectX 9 compatible notebooks and tablets.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Feature Tests</h2><br><strong>NVIDIA DLSS feature test - Compare DLSS performance and image quality</strong><br>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA RTX technology that uses the power of deep learning and AI to improve game performance while maintaining visual quality. This feature test helps you compare performance and image quality with and without DLSS.<br><br><strong>API Overhead feature test - Compare the latest graphics APIs</strong><br>The 3DMark API Overhead feature test is the world's first independent test for comparing the performance of DirectX 12, DirectX 11 and Vulkan. See how many draw calls your PC can handle with each API before the frame rate drops below 30 FPS.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stress Tests</h2><strong>Check the stability of your system</strong><br>Stress testing is a good way to check the reliability and stability of your system after buying or building a new PC, upgrading your graphics card, or overclocking your GPU.
