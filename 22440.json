And what horrors lie in the depths of the murky swamp? <strong>Point Lookout</strong> is the most open-ended DLC yet, and allows you to explore an entirely new and expansive gameplay area any way you’d like. A completely new quest line allows you uncover the town’s hidden secrets, and wield powerful new weapons like the Double-Barrel Shotgun against the swamp’s dangerous, and deformed, denizens. So venture to <strong>Point Lookout</strong>, if you dare. Just pray it’s not a one-way trip.\n\t\t\t\t\t",
