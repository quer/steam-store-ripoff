While navigation may be cumbersome, it’s definitely not a deal breaker, and it’s far too easy to get sucked into the game and never want to stop until you reach the conclusion.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/nancy-drew-ghost-thornton-hall/review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamezebo</a><br><br>“The mystery for Nancy to solve is as intriguing as ever, the writing and voice-acting is solid (though a bit cheesy in places), puzzles are challenging, and the atmosphere is suitably creepy. Nancy Drew: Ghost of Thornton Hall debuts two wonderful gameplay additions: an expanded hints system and the ability to fast-forward through dialog.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/nancy-drew-ghost-of-thornton-hall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Common Sense Media</a><br><br>“It’s yet another solid adventure game in a series that has always been among the best the genre has to offer. I have no idea how Her Interactive manages to keep their level of quality so high in such a consistent manner, but whatever they’re doing, it works.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://truepcgaming.com/2013/05/13/nancy-drew-ghost-of-thorton-hall-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >True PC Gaming</a><br>",
