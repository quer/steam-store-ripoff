Only your  wits  and the  ability to combine ingenious traps to setup deadly ambushes  will give you a chance to see the sun rise again on your frozen piece of forest...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Plan your strategy!</strong> – Take advantage of the calm during the day to fill your forest with all kinds of traps that are as inventive as they are deadly.<br></li><li><strong>Hunt your enemies!</strong> – When night falls, use the wind and lure the diabolic beasts into your traps using bait... But watch out! You have to be on constant guard to make sure you don't become the prey of the beasts you are tracking!<br></li><li><strong>Fight heroically!  </strong> – If some of the beasts get past your traps, that's when it gets bloody! First you can shoot them with your trusty musket and then eliminate the ones that survive by slaughtering them with your axe! Action and carnage guaranteed!<br></li><li><strong>Use fear to your advantage!</strong> – All the mechanics of the game revolve around the innovative concept of Fear Factor, which makes your ability to intimidate your enemy your best weapon. For example, use fire to frighten the wolves and scatter their packs. <br></li><li><strong>Customize your character!</strong> – Choose one of the two O'Carroll brothers and develop your character using a skill system based on role-playing games (RPGs), making your hero as unique as he is powerful!<br></li><li><strong>Discover a rich universe!</strong> – Immerse yourself in 19th century Canada where legends meet History in a world filled with lore and wonders.
