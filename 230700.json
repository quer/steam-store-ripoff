Art, music, breadth of content, game length -- La-Mulana gets the highest marks. But there's simply no denying that the difficulty, as fair as Nigoro purports it to be, is a major deterrent. If you are willing to suffer, though, you will be blown away.

It is long, it is tough, it is involved and it has puzzles that’ll make your brain bleed.&quot;<br>93/100 – <a href=\"http://www.indiegamemag.com/la-mulana-review/#.UE_rjfm0MxQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Indie Game Mag</a><br><br>&quot;I look back on my time with La-Mulana with plenty of frustration at the challenging platforming, enemies, bosses, and puzzles.
