            "reviews": "&quot;Successfully reloading a gun for the first time through sheer muscle memory is easily one of the greatest feelings in gaming.&quot;<br>8.5/10 – <a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-receiver-250769.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br><br>&quot;Receiver is interesting for two things. One, it focuses on a single weapon, the Colt 1911 A1, and takes it very seriously, using &quot;high detail gun mechanics&quot;, which means you can &quot;manipulate each part of the gun independently&quot; (the beginning of the video shows this in action). The second is that it's a randomly-generated shooter that features permanent death. Taking place inside a single building, every time you die, you have to start at the very beginning again, but the entire game world is re-rolled. It's available now for $5, which given the ideas on show, is totally worth it just to check it out.&quot;<br>– <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5919788/the-shooter-that-changes-every-time-you-die\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>&quot;Receiver didn’t cast me as some nigh-invincible mass of regenerating muscle. The end result, then, was that I felt exactly how I’d expect Real Me would in a combat situation involving live ammo.&quot;<br>– <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/06/20/impressions-wolfires-hyper-realistic-gun-sim-receiver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a>",
