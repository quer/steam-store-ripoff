As you move through the ages of history you will make critical decisions that will impact your relationship with other civilizations. <br><br>Sid Meier’s Civilization V: Brave New World also introduces nine new civilizations, eight new wonders, two new scenarios, four new gameplay systems and dozens of new units, buildings and improvements offering an expanded variety of ways to build the most powerful empire in the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><strong>New Culture Victory:</strong> Spread your culture across the globe, dominating all other cultures. Create masterpieces with Great Artists, Writers and Musicians that are placed in key buildings across your empire like Museums, Opera Houses, and even the Great Library.
