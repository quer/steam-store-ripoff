She could not shake the feeling, eventually leading her to make a mistake in the battlefield. Despite this, she was able to defeat the enemies with Nisha’s help.

To prevent Laby from disappearing, Nisha turned her into a mirror and promised to make this world a place just for Laby - where she can be happy like before. <br><br>Rusty Child, Daydreamer, and Nisha Labyrinth; come to realize the nature of their existence... together. Until the day all light fades to nothing.<br><br>Dark path stans and Laby lovers unite! Today is the day you’ve all been waiting for! The gloom and doom of Nisha is upon us!
