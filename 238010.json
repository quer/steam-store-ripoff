Human Revolution would bear replaying even without the enhancements — it's a rare title that combines superb world building and storytelling with such dedication to player choice. I lost myself in the world of Human Revolution, and relished every opportunity to dive deeper into its mysteries.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/10/18/4851642/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut-review-all-tomorrows-parties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Polygon</a><br><br>“With a story that lasts hours on end, additional DLC that will keep you challenged throughout (wait till you get to Missing Link), unbeatable touch-screen implementation and a majority of the same great stuff from the original release, the Director's Cut of Deus Ex: Human Revolution definitely deserves a look. This is how the game was meant to be played, especially on the Wii U, even with its wide control set-up. It's easily an advantage that the system needs this holiday season.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamerhub.tv/reviews/deux-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut-is-a-well-oiled-machine/2013/10/22/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamerHub TV</a><br>",
