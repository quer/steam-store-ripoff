While the game draws on identifiable sources such as Quake, The Sims, and Clue, it mashes these elements together with a few new ideas to create an innovative experience that doesn't play like any of its inspirations.”<br>8.3 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-ship-review/1900-6154689/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamespot</a><br><br>“the game twists around the Clue formula to make it a little more interesting. Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so there are plenty of lethal odds-and-ends to wield, and even some environmental traps. It's certainly a quirky take on first-person gaming, but it's an entertaining one once you get the hang of it.”<br>7.4 – <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2006/08/25/the-ship-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN</a><br>",
