It has a deep, complex story, and how much of it you uncover will be directly related to how you choose to interact with the people you encounter.”<br>80% – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gripyajoystick.com/inquisitor-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >SnackbarGames</a><br><br>“In the end, Inquisitor is a bit like an old school RPG holy water : faithful worshippers see it as a consecration and a benediction, less motivated believers handle it with more or less indifference, but heretics and possessed will cry out in pain when touching it. Nonetheless, it is definitely a ceremonial jewel that promises a unique, visceral and generous experience. An experience that stands out from nowaday's video game scene with its anti-consensual, challenging but rewarding approach.”<br>90% – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.rpgfrance.com/test-10013-1-test-inquisitor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >RPG France</a><br>",
