And you really should play something in this series if you have the faintest whiff of interest in RTS, because it is one of the great masterworks. To not play it is to waste your life.”<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/15/men-of-war-assault-squad-2-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>“With a substantial graphical upgrade, a bunch of new units and a fleshed out multiplayer component (as well as skirmishes, finally), every fan is bound to get hours upon hours of fun, visceral and emergent gameplay. In case you haven't had contact with an Assault Squad game and you're an RTS gamer, you will not be disappointed. That's a recommendation right there.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/men-war-assault-squad-2-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Mouse N Joypad</a><br><br>“Accidentally discovering something awesome will soon become a four-word summary of my time with Assault Squad 2. [...] I love Assault Squad 2, but it was not an easy romance. Its brutal difficulty spikes and hands-off approach to training should serve as a warning to all but the most grizzled of armchair generals: this game is war, and war is hell.”<br><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/review/men-of-war-assault-squad-2-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a><br>",
