Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored.<br><br>Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes.<br><br>Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.<br><br>Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future.<br><br>Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Access</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Planets and moons</strong> – inspired by real celestial objects (Earth, Mars, Alien, Moon, Europa, Titan), fully destructible &amp; persistent, volumetric, atmosphere, gravity, climate zones<br></li><li><strong>Game modes</strong><br> - Creative – unlimited resources, instant building, no death<br> - Survival – realistic management of resources and inventory capacity; manual building; death and respawn<br></li><li><strong>Single-player</strong> – you are the sole space engineer<br></li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong> - alpha version (not a final version)<br> - Creative and survival mode with your friends<br> - Cooperative and competitive<br> - Privacy customization: offline, private, friends only, public<br> - Max 16 players (this may increase in the future)<br> - Weapons on/off<br> - Copy-paste on/off<br></li><li><strong>Starting Worlds</strong><br> - Earth Easy Start - start on a habitable planet with a set of basic vehicles.

Make sure you secure a source of water soon. Also beware of local pirates.<br> - Alien Easy Start – the alien planet is a place with very sparse oxygen, not enough to breath freely. There is hostile fauna and pirates who want to claim the riches of this mysterious world and are not willing to share.<br> - Moon Easy Start – You start on a moon orbiting a habitable planet. Your base is under attack by pirates.<br> - Empty Star System - It is a star system with 3 distinctive planets and their 3 moons.
