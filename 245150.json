The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that they’re sharing the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRead the family’s thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can’t help the Kaplans if they know there’s a ghost in the house. It’s up to you to decide how Dan’s career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDan’s relationships – to his work, his wife, and his son – react and shift in response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe decisions you make will define the Kaplans’ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.",

I frequently cried at the outcomes of the decisions I made for the Kaplan family.”<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/novelist-heart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br><br>“While it arrives on the heels of other notable non-combat, story-based games, it still manages to feel fresh and emotionally resonant. This is thanks to sincere, realistic writing and an inspired approach to player choice, which has you picking sides and making difficult compromises in the context of family conflicts.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/11/5201512/the-novelist-review-compromise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Polygon</a><br><br>“The Novelist is the most personal and beautiful game I have ever experienced.
