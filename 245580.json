The Su-25 has seen combat in several conflicts during its more than 25 years in service. The Su-25 combines excellent pilot protection and high speed compared to most dedicated attack aircraft. It can be armed with a variety of weapon systems including guided missiles, bombs, rockets, and its internal 30mm cannon.<br><br>The Su-25 is the forerunner of the Su-25T (included for free in DCS World) and has much in common with the Su-25T. Although the Su-25 lacks some of sensors and weapons of the Su-25T, it provides better flight performance and is a more simple aircraft to operate. The Su-25 has been produced in great numbers and has seen service in many air forces around the world; more so than any later version of the 'Frogfoot'. <br><br>Su-25 for DCS World  focuses on ease of use without complicated cockpit interaction, significantly reducing the learning curve.

It is equipped with a single K-36L Zvezda ejection seat.<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong><br>The wings have ten pylons for carrying a range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapon systems selected for the mission. Air-to-ground missiles include Kh-25ML (AS-10 Karen) and Kh-29L (AS-14 Kedge). The air-to-air missile carried on the smaller outboard pylons is the R-60 (AA-8 Aphid).<br><br>The aircraft can be fitted with UB-32A pods for 57mm S-5 rockets, B-8M1 pods for 80mm S-8 rockets, S-24 240mm guided rockets and S-25 330mm guided rockets.<br>The Su-25 can be armed with 350kg-670kg laser-guided bombs, 500kg incendiary devices and cluster bombs.<br><br>The aircraft's twin-barrel gun, the 30mm GSh-30-2, is installed in the underside of the fuselage on the port side. The gun is armed with 250 rounds of ammunition and is capable of firing at a burst rate of 3,000 rounds a minute. SPPU-22 gun pods can also be installed on the underwing pylons. The pods carry the GSh-23 23mm twin-barrel guns, each with 260 rounds of ammunition.<br><br><strong>Targeting</strong><br>The aircraft is equipped with an integrated navigation and aiming system, including ASP-17 BTs-8 gun / bomb sight with an AKS-750s camera installed in the nose.
