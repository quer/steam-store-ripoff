            "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Synopsis</h2>A corrupt and bizarre town is the quirky setting to Jeklynn Heights, a fantastical and competitive online game. Run by a Mayor with a split personality and enigmatic past, a spell haunts the town he rules. Players must complete objectives, directed by the Mayor, to win and escape the town.  Combat is 3rd person melee, ranged, and ability based.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Match Setup</h2>There are two teams in Jeklynn Heights - the rich and the poor.  The objective is simple; leave town!  During the beginning of the match, the Mayor introduces himself and calls out the first event.  Events are mini-objectives which last a few minutes each.  Objectives range from capturing points, killing targets, stealing from the other team, collecting resources, etc.  The first team to win 5 events wins the match, and is allowed to leave the town!<br><br>The game is designed to be fast paced, focusing on team-based play, high action, and very short respawn times.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Combat Mechanics</h2><u>Melee/Ranged Combat</u><br>Every character has a 3 swing melee rotation and a blocking ability.  You may hold your blocking stance for 2 seconds to deflect incoming melee damage.  Landing a quick block (blocking a melee attack within 0.5 seconds of using your block), will stun the enemy player and grant you an empowered swing that does bonus damage.<br><br>All characters also have a dash mechanic.  Dashing propels you a short distance forward and grants you an empowered swing that does bonus damage.  Dashing is a great opportunity to travel faster, initiate combat, or narrowly escape danger.<br><br>Additionally, you also have a ranged weapon unique to your character to make picking off fleeing enemies easier!<br><br><u>Abilities/Spells</u><br>Characters have 4 abilities centered around their specific archetype (tank/support/agility based).  Abilities range from AOE damage, skill shots, disables, movement boosts, and buffs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mayor Events</h2>Events are randomized every match.
