Cook, Serve, Delicious: Battle Kitchen Edition is a brand new free expansion that provides all new local multiplayer modes and weekly challenges! From 25 indie guest cameos to tons of new features and improvements, CSD: Battle Kitchen will challenge even the most hardened cook. Some of the new features include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Tag Team Local Multiplayer</strong>- Grab some controllers and play up to four players locally as you take turns manning the chef station in Battle Kitchen. You only have fifteen seconds to cook, and five seconds to explain to the next cook what to do first! Good luck!<br></li><li><strong>Strike Challenges</strong>- Take on twelve brand new challenges on your own or up to four players tag team with adjustable difficulty settings. Warning: these challenges can be extremely difficult!<br></li><li><strong>Endurance Mode</strong>- For one player or up to four Tag Team players, Endurance Mode has you making as many foods as possible perfectly, all while having to answer Chef Risotto's calls and switching out menu items and upgrading them while you're cooking. How long can you last? Also includes the new eSports Endurance Challenge, an event that ups the difficulty to an extreme degree!<br></li><li><strong>Co-op Campaign</strong>- Play the campaign mode with a friend using your current save! One person is the expediter, who must give orders to the chef and send them out when they're fully cooked, and the other is the chef, unable to choose orders but must cook or do anything the expediter gives them. Tag each other to switch positions on the fly, and make your way from a zero star cafe to a five star restaurant! (co-op can be enabled or disabled at any time in the main menu of the campaign mode).<br></li><li><strong>Game Improvements</strong>- A huge array of game improvements and additions have been added to the game!

            "short_description": "One of the few hardcore restaurant sims in existence, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a deceptively easy game to learn but incredibly challenging to master as you progress through your career from owning a terrible zero star cafe into a five star world famous restaurant.",

            "reviews": "“Along with being one of the (very unexpectedly!) funniest games I’ve played this year, the game’s disarming &amp; charming aesthetic did not prepare me for what is undoubtedly the best WarioWare-like game I have ever played. In fact, I probably ended up spending more time with Cook, Serve, Delicious! than with almost any other game this year. The gameplay is simple in nature but blisteringly fast, resulting in a challenge that is more than enough to keep the average player interested. The game does not overstay its welcome, as it evolves in numerous ingenious ways by the time you’ve reached the end.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://thestereogram.com/2013/02/cook-serve-delicious-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Stereogram</a><br><br>“It's not an easy game to excel at, but it's an easy game to get hooked on, and the challenge of building and running your own restaurant from front to back is going to captivate you for weeks on end...with depth to rival a strategy game and carefully controlled chaos ruling the action sequences, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a rare release that encourages you to play until you master every nuance of gameplay.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/archives/2012/11/cook_serve_delicious.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Jay Is Games</a><br><br>“Cook, Serve, Delicious! is fast paced, engaging, and absolutely addictive for foodies or non-foodies alike.
