Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. This world was not made for you to understand. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut as you explore, slowly, meaning begins to arise, the paradoxes might start to make sense, perhaps you are powerful after all. The game is not here to fight you; it is inviting you to dance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the award-winning 2011 Source mod of the same name, The Stanley Parable returns with new content, new ideas, a fresh coat of visual paint, and the stunning voicework of Kevan Brighting.
