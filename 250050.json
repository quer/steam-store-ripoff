Wanting to live forever, a mighty king sends his army of knights to find the Cup of Life. On this quest, you will summon knight after knight to be brutally sacrificed. Impale knights on spikes to create a safe path. Catch a knight on a sawblade to land the body on a button. Freeze knights into blocks of ice to reach higher ground.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/250050/extras/knights_three_squares_600W.png?t=1515048635\" ><br><br>You’ll also electrocute knights to open doors, blast knights out of cannons, and even zombify a knight to be your violent, dim-witted friend. As you journey through treacherous and trap-ridden worlds, you’ll show no mercy to solve each challenging puzzle.<br><br>In this game, death is not a setback. It is your only means to progress.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><strong>You must die to solve puzzles.</strong><br>We hope you’re okay with killing knights, since this is a pretty twisted way to solve puzzles!

Trust us.<br><br><strong>Vibrant, trap-ridden worlds.</strong><br>Journey through 65+ levels within four vibrant, colourful worlds full of lava, ice, spike pits, portals, zombies, cannons, and much more.
