Built to counter the American F-15 Eagle, the Flanker is a twin-engine, supersonic, highly maneuverable air superiority fighter. The Flanker is equally capable of engaging targets well beyond visual range as it is in a dogfight given its amazing slow speed and high angle attack maneuverability. Using its radar and stealthy infrared search and track system, the Flanker can employ a wide array of radar and infrared guided missiles. The Flanker also includes a helmet-mounted sight that allows you to simply look at a target to lock it up! In addition to its powerful air-to-air capabilities, the Flanker can also be armed with bombs and unguided rockets to fulfil a secondary ground attack role. <br><br>Su-27 for DCS World focuses on ease of use without complicated cockpit interaction, significantly reducing the learning curve.
