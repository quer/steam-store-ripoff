It feels free, like playing with Legos as kid. You have agency. There are all sorts of weird ways to play. You can transform into a zombie if you want, try and spread a plague, mix things up. Oh, and beware of LawyerCats. They’re out for blood.”<br />\r\nIndie Statik<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“... this is a must play”<br />\r\n9.5/10 – Gaming Capacity<br />\r\n",
