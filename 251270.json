Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of escape – much less survival – is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.<br><br><i>Corpse Party</i> is the original Windows edition of the cult classic horror game that gained a considerable fanbase when released on Sony’s PlayStation®Portable system in 2011. Beginning life as an independent RPG Maker adventure title in 1996, the gameplay was greatly refined and the story greatly expanded for this 2008 remake, featuring more characters, more detailed interactions, darker story elements, over 5,000 lines of voice-acting and dozens of shocking, gruesome endings. Players take control of nine main characters and several side characters who’ve been split up into groups of two or three and trapped in a run-down, otherworldly elementary school full of vengeful spirits, deadly mysteries and – of course – corpses. As they walk around examining objects and bodies in an atmospheric 2D environment, a horror tale spanning over 50 years begins to unfold, and player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY FEATURES</strong></h2><strong>Highly Detailed Retro-Style Graphics Used to Enhance Atmosphere</strong><br>Modeled after the very first RPG Maker <i>Corpse Party</i>, the game’s 16-bit-style 2D visuals help create an intentional disconnect that sparks the imagination, leading the player to envision far worse things than even the most powerful next-gen system could display.<br><br><strong>Adventure-Style Gameplay Where Your Decisions Make All the Difference</strong><br>Playing like a cross between a point-and-click adventure game and a classic JRPG sans battles, <i>Corpse Party</i> gives players the freedom to thoroughly explore every last corner of Heavenly Host Elementary School, significantly altering the course of the story and its final conclusion based on where the characters go and what they do.<br><br><strong>Chapter-Based Storytelling with PC-Exclusive Content</strong><br>The tale is told through five main chapters with multiple endings each and numerous scenes that differ from the game’s PSP™ system and Nintendo 3DS™ system counterparts. In addition, there are four bonus chapters, one of which is a PC-exclusive retelling of the “Tooth” story from <i>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows</i>, recreated with added content in classic <i>Corpse Party</i> adventure style.<br><br><strong>Original Japanese Voice Cast and Character Art plus Text Skip Feature</strong><br>Over 5,000 lines of spoken Japanese dialogue from the original indie voice cast complement the action, giving new spins on familiar characters for series veterans.
