Leadwerks is the perfect pathway to go from total noob to pro game developer.  And when you do publish your commercial game, there's no royalties to pay, ever.<br><br><strong>New Global Illumination and Volumetric Effects</strong><br>Leadwerks Game Engine 4.1 introduces environment probes for global illumination and reflections, along with volumetric lighting effects, all in an easy-to-control and intuitive interface.  This makes it easier than ever to create games with amazing graphics.<br><br><strong>New Vegetation Painting System</strong><br>Leadwerks Game Engine 4 introduces a one-of-a-kind vegetation system for handling massive amounts of foliage. Instead of storing each instance in memory, our new system uses a distribution algorithm to dynamically calculate all relevant instances each frame for rendering and physics. This allows enormous densely packed scenes with minimal overhead. The results are blazingly fast, efficient, and easy to use.  In fact, our new system is so advanced it's featured in the book <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1498755658/?tag=terathon-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Engine Gems 3</a>.<br><br><strong>Advanced Graphics</strong><br>Leadwerks makes AAA graphics achievable with hardware tessellation, geometry shaders, and a deferred renderer with up to 32x MSAA.

Anyone can build their own game worlds in Leadwerks, without having to be an expert artist.<br><br><strong>Integrated Lua Script Editor</strong><br>We integrated Lua right into Leadwerks because of its proven track records in hundreds of commercial games including Crysis, World of Warcraft, and Garry's Mod. Lua integrates seamlessly with native code for rapid prototyping and instant control.  The built-in debugger lets you pause your game, step through code, and inspect every variable in the program in real-time.  Lua is perfect for beginners, and the integrated Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler ensures your games will keep running fast as they grow.  (Please note that C++ programming support requires the Standard Edition DLC.)<br><br><strong>Visual Flowgraph for Advanced Game Mechanics</strong><br>Our unique visual flowgraph enables designers to set up game mechanics, build interactions, and design advanced scripted sequences, without touching a line of code.
