            "reviews": "“MouseCraft is a game that manages to take inspiration from two classic titles and create something fun. The fact that I became obsessed with making sure every mouse made it through the obstacle course tells you how addictive this game can be. Of the 80 levels included, there are a few that can stop you in your tracks and put you off from returning, but that minor flaw aside, MouseCraft is a great game that puzzle fans should take a look at.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/07/08/mousecraft-review-ps4-ps3-vita-pc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Sixth Axis</a><br><br>“If you’re a fan of puzzle games, don’t miss Crunching Koalas’ brilliant remix. MouseCraft drops you into a series of challenges that will initially make you feel like a mouse trapped in a maze. But after working your way through these environments, you’ll feel like a mad scientist who can’t be stopped.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/mousecraft/b/pc/archive/2014/08/05/mousecraft-game-informer-review.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Informer</a><br><br>“Offering up a new experience every time the mice finish their well-deserved cheese, MouseCraft is a refreshing experience for those in need of a complex puzzle game. It may not be has light-hearted as it could have been, but Mousecraft succeeds by making the player think instead of laugh. With fresh ideas in every level diminishing the possibility of boredom, who needs simplicity?”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/07/08/review-mousecraft/92943/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hardcore Gamer</a><br>",
