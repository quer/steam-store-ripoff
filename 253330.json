Make no mistake, it's still a horror game first and foremost, but that extra little bit of dark knowledge is unsettling. The terror feels more real, more concrete, than any other horror game I've played in recent memory.”<br>7/10 – <a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-neverending-nightmares-282258.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br>",
