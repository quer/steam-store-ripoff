We have also added new character controls and characters in both the ARPG and Platformer Players!  What you will really see is the POWER and SPEED that comes with this update, allowing users to create lush scenes, filled with assets, foliage and other features and functionality. <br><br>AGFPRO v3.0 is a comprehensive toolset designed to provide game developers and enthusiasts with a powerful and rapid level creation, terrain/vegetation editing, lighting and atmosphere system. <br><br>AGF is an independent product that empowers users to create game levels and environments for many types of game genres, and the AGFPRO v3.0 PREMIUM version is also designed to work in concert with the Free and Pro versions of the Unity 5 game engine to allow further customization and game publishing. AGF runs on the PC, MAC and LINUX systems.  <br><br>AGF allows developers to rapidly create game maps, sculpt terrain and design levels quickly and easily. With over 1000+ assets pre-stocked in the warehouse, along with 48 pre-set themes and 8 sample maps, developers and enthusiasts can begin creating levels in minutes. AGFPRO v3.0 includes all of the necessary tools to allow users the ability to import AGF scenes into Unity3d Free and Pro 5.  <br><br>Please note that due to Unity's change in business model from free and paid versions to a subscription model, we have been unable to maintain updates to align with our development pipeline and business model.  AGFPRO works as a standalone product for hobbyists as well as for developers who work from Unity 5 through January 2018.  Be advised that if you plan to use AGFPRO for professional game development, there may be certain features in recent Unity updates that do not work.<br><br>Creating game levels and maps in AGFPRO is easy and fun - now ANYONE can create their own quality game maps without having to program, model or animate!<br><br>In order to use AGFPRO Premium (DLC), you must first purchase AGFPRO.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES:</h2><br><strong>AGFPRO v3.0 now Features Nine (9) Key Areas or Apps for Development that Include:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>AGF Launch Pad<br></li><li>AGF World Editor<br></li><li>AGF Construct App<br></li><li>AGF Browser<br></li><li>AGF Packager<br></li><li>AGF Scene Loader<br></li><li>ARPG Player (Internal &amp; External)<br></li><li>Platform Player (Internal &amp; External)<br></li><li>FPS Player (External)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New v3.0 AGF<i> Launch Pad</i>:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This App replaces the AGF editor from the AGF icon in Steam<br></li><li>Launches all AGF Apps including the <strong><i>Editor</i></strong> from one toolbar<br></li><li>No need to go through the Editor to launch the <strong><i>Players</i></strong></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New v3.0 AGF <strong><i>World Editor</i></strong> Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Redesigned GUI in the<strong><i> Editor</i></strong><br></li><li>Dropdown menu system<br></li><li>Collapsing, drag-able windows with easy to see icons<br></li><li>3x Speed increase for terrain sculpting<br></li><li>New Smoothing feature for the terrain sculpting has been added to give the user the ability to smooth and soften terrain on their maps<br></li><li>New X, Y, Z directional compass added to the <strong><i>Editor</i></strong><br></li><li>Camera automatically changes the atmosphere when users are underwater vs. above water<br></li><li>Addition of &quot;Build Time Clock&quot; that is saved with each scene file every time users work, creating a standing time on how long each level takes to create</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>User-Friendly Project Creation Wizard</strong><br></li><li>  o\tExtensive library of pre-set themes for immediate level design<br></li><li>  o\tThemes include lighting, atmosphere, terrain, vegetation, &amp; water pre-defined</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Intuitive User Interface with &quot;Radial Menu&quot; to expedite workflow</strong> <br></li><li>Drag and reorganize windows to customize UI<br></li><li>On &amp; Off feature quickly hide menus</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Advanced Terrain Creation System</strong><br></li><li>Adjustable: terrain size, splat map &amp; vegetation detail resolution<br></li><li>Supports terrains from 200 meters up to 200 meters down max<br></li><li>Terrains are now expanded to a maximum terrain of 4,000 meters square<br></li><li>3x Speed increase for terrain sculpting<br></li><li>10 levels of undo for terrain editing<br></li><li>Undo Vegetation, Painting and Sculpting independent of each other</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Paint, Sculpt and Plant vegetation individually or simultaneously</strong><br></li><li>Toggle: terrain visibility, painting, sculpting, planting</li></ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Sophisticated Brush Support</strong><br></li><li>Extensive brush library with adjustable brush size, rotation, power, blend<br></li><li>Edit the entire Default Brush library for users preference<br></li><li>Project specific and default brushes independent of each other<br></li><li>Via the new integrated <strong><i>AGF Browser</i></strong>, users can now import their own original:  Brushes, Terrain Textures, Terrain Vegetation Textures in PNG.
