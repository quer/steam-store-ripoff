It had twin crew cabs positioned some distance from either end of the loco with small windows for forward vision, giving a driving compartment much like conventional steam locomotives. The GG1 was a truly impressive locomotive, measuring over 79 feet long and weighing in at 475,000 pounds (215 metric tons), and capable of 100mph on lines like the Northeast Corridor. 140 were built for the PRR, eventually passing into new ownership and continuing to work for Amtrak, Conrail and Penn Central with several remaining in preservation today.<br><br>This add-on livery pack presents the locomotive in the silver with red stripe variation of the PRR liveries.<br><br><strong>You must own the PRR GG1 Loco Add-on before you will be able to use this add-on</strong>",
