It’s definitely a refreshing, thorough and intricate take on the genre. It’s very well written and I found it a bit of a ‘page turner’ the ending is satisfying and makes sense.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamersftw.co.uk/j-u-l-among-stars-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamers FTW</a><br><br>“J.U.L.I.A.
