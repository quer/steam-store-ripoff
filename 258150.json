There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it‘s up to you to decide how you will play through both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, you will need to use your strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith highly replayable missions, achievements, weapons to unlock and two single-player campaigns, Arma Tactics offers many hours of intense ever-changing action.",
