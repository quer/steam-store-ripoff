The four-car units were able to run on both overhead electrification – on lines north of Farringdon - and third rail pick-up, for lines south of Farringdon.<br><br>Two sub-classes were originally built and over the years, the 86 trainsets have been refurbished, creating five sub-classes in total, of which four still exist.
