Several examples were original built as streamlined, but this was later removed.<br><br>They were, quite simply, a beast of British steam traction – the Class was estimated to produce 3,300 horsepower and weighed 105 tons with a coal fuel capacity of nine tons and carrying 4,000 gallons of water. Their prestigious standing saw many of the Class head express steam passenger services across the LMS network from the mid-1930s through to their withdrawal in the mid-1960s.<br><br>‘Duchess of Sutherland’ was outshopped in July 1938 as part of the third batch of her Class. During her 25 years of service, she ran 1.6m miles – the second highest mileage by any member of her Class. <br><br>The locomotive was withdrawn from mainline service in 1964 but never saw a scrapyard, instead being purchased by a Butlins holiday camp in Scotland and then by a Steam Museum. Since 1996, she has been owned by the Duchess Trust and is in regular use on rail tours across the country.<br><br>The Duchess of Sutherland for Train Simulator is available in BR Brunswick Green livery and is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to Train Simulator standard, including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling.
