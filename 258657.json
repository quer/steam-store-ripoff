When introduced, the Castle Class was heralded as Britain’s most powerful express passenger locomotive with an average operating speed of 80mph (129 km/h) and a top recorded speed of 108mph (174 km/h).<br><br>The first models in the Class were built in 1923 for the GWR at Swindon Works; construction continued at intervals until 1950, by which time 171 locomotives had been built. The first withdrawals started in the 1950s, with the last Castle Class being withdrawn in November 1965.<br><br>However, eight locomotives in the Class have been preserved with two currently certified for mainline running. These preserved locomotives are often called upon to haul named special railtour services, including <i>The Cornishman</i>, <i>The Bristolian</i> and <i>The Cornish Riviera Express</i>.<br><br>The Castle Class for Train Simulator is available early BR and late BR Brunswick Green liveries, as it operated for BR in the 1950s - 1960s, and includes a Collett 4,000 gallon tender.
