Seeking a new fleet of state-of-the art electrics, NJ TRANSIT contracted with Adtranz (now part of Bombardier) in Kassel, Germany to construct 29 electric locomotives designed based on the Deutsche-Bahn Class-101 electric. Classified as ALP-46s on NJ TRANSIT, the electrics (NJT 4600-4628) began arriving in 2001 and each packed 7,100-horsepower into a stylish 64-foot-long, dual-cab carbody. Riding Flexifloat trucks in a B-B wheel arrangement and with a drive system that incorporates a transformer, two traction converters, and MITRAC electronic control systems, the ALP-46s comfortably handle 10-car NJT consists at 100 mph. <br><br>Wearing NJ TRANSIT’s striking livery designed by Cesar Vergara, the ALP-46s regularly serve on multiple NJ TRANSIT routes, including the Amtrak-owned Northeast Corridor between New York Penn Station and Trenton, New Jersey; the North Jersey Coast Line; and NJ TRANSIT’s Morristown Line. Efficient and powerful, the ALP-46 is a superb and authentic locomotive for service on Train Simulator’s NJCL route. <br><br>The ALP-46 includes a range of advanced features including NJ TRANSIT’s in-cab signal system and is accompanied by NJ TRANSIT’s Comet IV commuter coach and a drivable Comet V cab-car for push-pull operations and NJ TRANSIT’s iconic MultiLevel Cars with driveable Cab Car. It also features three Career Scenarios for the North Jersey Coast Line route. <br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the NJ TRANSIT ALP-46 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/325970/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >North Jersey Coast Line</a> (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Career Scenarios</h2><br>The ALP-46 includes three Career Scenarios for the NJCL route: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>Electric Avenue <br></li><li>Changing the Fuse <br></li><li>A Shock to the System</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
