Based on the Class 376 used by Southeastern, the ‘Capitalstar’ was specifically designed for the London Overground network with a focus on easy access and capacity - coaches do not have doors or partitions between them, creating an open end to end interior space allowing easier movement along the train during peak times and more standing room for passengers.<br><br>A total of 20 four-car units, classified as Class 378/1, currently operate on the East London Line and South London Line, and 37 units, running as Class 378/2, can be seen on the North London Line, West London Line and Watford DC Line. Class 378/1 units run on 750 V DC third rail only; Class 378/2 units run on 750 V DC third rail and 25 kV AC overhead lines.<br><br>Both variations of the EMU are represented in the model for Train Simulator, with DMSO, MSO and PTSO coaches. Features include two-tone horn, ‘Underground’ style whistle and passenger view.<br><br>The EMU is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the London Overground Class 378 ‘Capitalstar’ on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
