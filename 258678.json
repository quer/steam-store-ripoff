Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users.  Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The ‘ugly duckling’ of Southern steam is now here for Train Simulator, brought to you by Victory Works.<br><br>World War II halted production of steam locomotives in the UK, but a large increase in goods traffic across the country forced a shortage of suitable motive power for the Southern Railway. The dated Q Class was seen as an obvious, but the SR’s Chief Mechanical Engineer, Oliver Bulleid, decided a new class of 0-6-0 steam locomotives was a much better replacement, using minimal resources due to wartime austerity and to reduce weight.<br><br>Built by SR’s Brighton and Ashford Works, the Q1 Class’ unique design saw it labelled with some less than favourable nicknames, however its lightweight construction meant it could operate across the majority of the Southern network, and it was even used occasionally on passenger services. The Q1 Class adequately met the Southern Railway’s wartime requirements and many of the Class continued into the post-war BR era, working over the Southern Region until the end of steam in the mid-1960s.<br><br>All but one of the Class were scrapped; the first locomotive built in the Class was preserved and ran until 2004 at the Bluebell Railway in West Sussex. It can now be seen on static display at the National Railway Museum in York, England.<br><br>The Bulleid Q1 Class for Train Simulator is available in Southern and BR liveries, with pre- and post-1956 BR logos. Extensive detailing of the model includes three driving modes, dynamic numbering  including optional fittings for all members of the class, multiple cab views, fully modelled and animated Stephenson’s Gear, realistic wheel slip physic and effects, cylinder cock management, realistic injector control, fully controllable steam sander, working tender controls and dynamic head disc/lamp settings.<br><br>Also included are a selection of World War II era wagons, including SR single conflats with containers, SR double conflats with loads including Spitfire fuselage, gun barrels, tree trunks and planks, Howitzer Railgun and SR Warwell with Cromwell tank.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Bulleid Q1 Class on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
