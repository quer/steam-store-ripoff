Look out for deadly artillery strikes from a Naval Destroyer anchored offshore.<br></li><li>Containment (Mexico): This smaller-sized map is set along a dry riverbed in a war-torn South American village.

Outfitted with a lightweight wood stock and a digital screen display, players can choose to use the Maverick as either an assault rifle or sniper rifle, depending on their tactical needs. As an Assault Rifle the weapon’s fire rate becomes fully auto with relatively high damage at range, and as a Sniper Rifle the Maverick sports an advanced scope and a semi-auto rate of fire.<br><br>Anchoring this first content pack is Episode 1: Nightfall, the first installment in Extinction’s four-part episodic narrative. At a remote facility in the Alaskan wilderness, the shadowy Nightfall Program has been researching the origins of the “Alien” threat. When the scientists lose control, a small team of elite soldiers must retrieve the intel and exterminate hordes of savage creatures while surviving a three-story tall terror unlike anything they’ve faced before. Featuring two all-new species of aliens and an exclusive weapon, Episode 1: Nightfall is a fast &amp; frenetic, action-packed continuation of the Extinction experience.",
