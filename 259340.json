There’s also fantastic barnyard music that stays with you long after you play and humorous squawking effects. ChickenShoot Demo was rated by Avault as Top Shareware of the year!”<br>Avault<br><br>“Brilliant visuals and tonal presentation, the variety of different objects, as well as the different game modes and many funny ideas make the game worth to give it a try.”<br>80 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcspielemagazin.de/spieletest_anzeigen.php?id=13020&amp;page=fazit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC Spielemagazin</a><br>",
