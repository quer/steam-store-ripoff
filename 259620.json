The grappling hook and anti-gravity pack are a lot of fun and add an interesting dynamic to the game. I love exploring the seemingly infinite world to find new items and situations.”<br />\r\n10/10 – Swawa3D @ IndieDB<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Just want to say again that this is a great game! For those of you who feel like its a minecraft copy just beacuse of the cube textures used you really need to rethink what a game is about! The game play of 3079 is nothing like minecraft it is pretty unique as well as how the weapons all have diffrent stats and colors kind of reminds me of Borderlands. However it is still an original idea for a game and i still play it from time to time. You should at least try the demo and if you like it please buy it and support fruit! :D Still give it a 9/10 ! Best Regards, Adam”<br />\r\n9/10 – SeaNanners<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“After playing this game all day, all i can think about is playing it more. It has an insane amount of replayability and the difficulty is random. Which is refreshing. Some enemies are difficult to kill and some are easy. The way the difficulty gets higher is based off the distance from where you start. Which is great.”<br />\r\n10/10 – Blackop2 @ IndieDB<br />\r\n",
