Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn’t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there’s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works. One moment you might be evading a giant boulder, only to be grabbing parachutes mid-air the next.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/review/home-sheep-home-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Thunderbolt Games</a><br><br>“It looks like many of you really looked forward to this title on the forums, and I can say that it's taken all the concepts from the first game and made them bigger and better, and it doesn't disappoint in its execution.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2011/12/23/home-sheep-home-2-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Touch Arcade</a><br>",
