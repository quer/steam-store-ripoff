Together you must defeat the evil that hides in the mist and uncover the mystery of Lights Out.<br><br>The game is best played in a dark room with your speakers turned up. Unless you're scared, of course.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2>Many lives have been lost on the lethal rocks surrounding the harbour town of Trewarthan.
