We’re using a cartoony art-style, but that’s it for the Facebook similarities. The game is closer compared to old-school SNES rpg's.<br><br><i>Q: Is this pay-to-win?  What’s up with the free-to-play thing?</i><br>A: That’s two questions, but I’ll let it slide this time.  This game has ABSOLUTELY NO pay-to-win elements.  <strong>We despise those mechanics and we’ll never go there.</strong>  We were initially calling ourselves free-to-play, but a lot of people got the wrong idea.  Now we have a Free Version (coming later) which will include all of the townbuilding/vanity stuff, but will not include Acts 1 - 3 of the RPG side of the game.  The full version includes everything.<br><br><i>Q: I remember the Kickstarter for this and you guys didn’t mention it was an RPG.  Is it really an RPG?</i><br>A: Absolutely!  A few things happened after the Kickstarter and we felt adding more RPG and story stuff to the game would make it better.  <br><br><i>Q: Is this a mobile game ported to desktop?  Because I heard…</i><br>A: You heard wrong, my friend :-)  We have designed the game to work on any device, including desktops.  In the past, the UI was very mobile friendly since that was easier for testing.  Now that we’re in beta, we’re splitting the UI and working on one specifically for desktop computers.<br><br><i>Q: Speaking of that, the controls are pretty stiff and limited.</i><br>A: That wasn’t a question, but yeah, we had a single control scheme during alpha.  Now that things are a bit more solid, <strong>we’re going to be adding WASD and gamepad movement support soon.</strong><br><br><i>Q: Hold on, why do I need to register an account on your site?!</i><br>A: In the future, it will be optional.  Right now we need players using accounts since it helps us with testing.  And hey, having an account lets you resume your game on any device, so it’s not all that bad.<br><br><i>Q: So I’ve been playing for a bit and I found some things aren’t fun.</i><br>A: Again, not a question…  <strong>So, if something isn’t fun, we’ll fix it.</strong>  That’s the point of Early Access :-)  Please let us know in our forums so we can discuss it with you and come up with a solution.  <br><br><i>Q: When will the game be done?</i><br>A: We’re hoping to having version 1.0 ready by August, but we’re a small team and things happen.  If there are delays, we’ll be sure to communicate them to you guys in our forums and updates.<br><br><i>Q: What about after that.  Any expansion plans?</i><br>A: We have about 4 expansions planned out so far, with a new one coming out once a year.  Each expansion will add new features, increase the level cap, and add a bunch more story content for Act 4 onwards.<br><br>Steam Bandits: Outpost will no longer receive updates as it will be split into smaller games soon.  Anyone that purchases Outpost will get a free copy of those games.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>** This game requires a constant internet connection since it's cloud based **</strong><br><br>Explore the skies of a Steampunk world while discovering islands, taming beasts, and battling anything that stands in your way.
