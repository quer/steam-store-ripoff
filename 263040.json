If you enjoy figuring out how to get through to robots,  command them through actions and investigate - you'll enjoy Bot Colony.

            "short_description": "Bot Colony is the only game relying on intelligent conversation (through speech or typing) as its key mechanic.

It was incredibly fun playing detective and trying to piece together what happened.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.darkstation.com/previews/bot-colony-preview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >DarkStation</a><br><br>“It’s not exactly Blade Runner‘s Voight Kampff test, but few, if any, games, offer this level of unscripted interaction. The game’s use of voice synthesis, which makes sense in this context, means that all the robots are fully voiced. Their pronunciation isn’t always dead on, though I still grinned like an idiot when I was able to get Jimmy to address me as Bruce Wayne. I spent a good hour picking through Jimmy’s recollections and even though we weren’t discussing anything deep, it was curiously satisfying.  In its current state, Bot Colony definitely has promise, provided that the game’s developers build on the quality of ‘Intruder’.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamespew.com/2017/03/bot-colony-preview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameSpew</a><br><br>“If the idea of talking to robots and telling them what to do sounds interesting to you, there is no other game that can offer you that.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gameskinny.com/zrhdg/preview-bot-colony-a-cool-concept-that-works-most-of-the-time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameSkinny</a><br>",
