            "short_description": "Join Ludwig on an exciting journey through the world of physics. Find out how energy is created from fire, water, wind and sun and use them cleverly to protect the Robotronics on Unitron against the impending energy collapse! Ludwig is a new type of learning game, which not only conveys knowledge, but is also really fun to play!",
