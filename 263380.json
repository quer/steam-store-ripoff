A fun, light-hearted game, with a more serious story running beneath it. And once it’s over, there’s still more to do.”<br>A Rare Gem – <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/15/wot-i-think-driftmoon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/15/wot-i-think-driftmoon/</a><br><br>“It's been a long time since I enjoyed a game as much as this one.
