(What's a 1.0, anyway?)<br><br><strong>First up on the changelist, Yooka and Laylee join the bottomless brawl! </strong>With a handful of devastating options for dealing with opponents right above them and Yooka's ability to eat and fire back projectiles, we see Yooka as a character with great doubles potential, as well as the tools to be <u>incredibly</u> disruptive against players who rely too much on projectiles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">In addition to Yooka and Laylee, we've added four more variants to the roster!</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Sting'ra</strong>, a Sephi'ra variant with midair charge attacks!<br></li><li><strong>Funkmaster</strong>, a superfly Apu variant who brings his disco ball and lowrider into the fight!<br></li><li><strong>Ripjack</strong>, a poisonous Volt variant, torn apart and rebuilt by Apucalypse for his band of wastelanders.<br></li><li><strong>Gancho Puncho</strong>, Paco's hat-tossing mariachi cousin!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mechanic updates:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Spike Canceling!</strong> If your character is hit by an attack that sends them within 35 degrees of straight down, you can now cancel your knockback and hitstun by either jumping or using your recovery move 17 frames after being hit. We've increased the knockback of some of the weaker spikes to compensate. <ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>Attempting to jump too early will impose a 40-frame lockout, essentially taking the opportunity to meteor cancel away from you. There is no lockout penalty for attempting to use your recovery move too early.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ledge Hanging!</strong> Currently this is limited to Yooka and Laylee, but it will be coming as a universal mechanic to the rest of the cast soon. <ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>Yooka can hang from the ledge without having to choose an option for a little while, with just enough invulnerability on the first ledgehang to give players enough time to dodge a cheesy edgeguard. </li> </ul> </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Balance changes:</h2><br>There's a bunch! Mostly minor tweaks here and there, but here are some of the headliners:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dr. Tysonstein has received a few reworks to his special attacks. <ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li>His neutral special has been replaced with a new move called &quot;Dynamo&quot;. Rather than a straight attack, it's now a buff that can be charged up to temporarily increase add the electrical effect to his normal attacks.<br> </li><li>His recovery move has been changed from Olaf's Pillar to a similar attack called &quot;Thunder Plate&quot;. This version of the attack no longer can be used to wall of sections of the stage<br></li><li>All of the Apus have smaller grab hitboxes<br></li><li>Many of the game's weaker spikes have been slightly improved to compensate for the new Spike Canceling mechanic.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Graphics and performance</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Many stages have improved or new lighting! Jungle Treetop is prettier than ever, and we're <u>pretty sure</u> the other stages look good too.<br></li><li>Better load times! It's a small improvement, but it's there!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Other stuff:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Random stage select!</strong> Give your stage choice to the RNG God instead of just playing Jungle Treetop because it was the first option :P<br></li><li><strong>NO MORE GEMS, CHARACTER UNLOCKING REWORK.</strong> All variants are now unlocked by leveling up the base character! <u>The first variant will unlock at level 3, the final variant will unlock at level 5.</u><br></li><li><strong>All stages unlocked from the start!</strong> No more unlocking stages, ever.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Future:</h2><br>It's been a wild ride, and we're not done yet! We still have TWO NEW CHARACTERS in the works right now, including the Prisoner from Dead Cells, that will arrive in free updates later this year! We might be out of Early Access, but we're still #workinghard!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>A new challenger has appeared in the platform fighter arena! </strong><br><br>Brawlout packs a punch with couch and online play modes, blending platform fighter mechanics and traditional fighting game play into a stylish and fluid battle royale. <br>Rather than slow-paced defensive battles, Brawlout goes all-out with the lightning-fast aerobatics which platform fighters are famous for. <br><br>Striking the balance between the growing competitive scene and the genre’s party game roots, Brawlout hopes to cater to the veteran platform fighter, the casual fan and the newcomer looking to make their mark.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/263720/extras/Brawlout_All_Characters_Banner_616.png?t=1534805160\" ><br><br>Each character in Brawlout has their own unique playstyle, catering to specific character archetypes seen in other fighters. Whether you’re a die-hard grappler or a rushdown fiend, there is a fighter for you in Brawlout.<br><br>There are currently six original characters and two popular indie characters to choose from that allow for varied play styles.<br><br>Hyper Light Drifter is set to unsheathe his light sword while the legendary luchador, Juan, brings his full moveset from Guacamelee.<br><br>As well as cosmetic skins, each original Brawlout character has three Variants; alt versions of the character with different stats, outfits and even new moves. With these Variants, Brawlout’s cast numbers 18 individual fighters. Find the fighter and Variant that’s right for you and tear it up on the battlefield.<br><br>Combined with familiar movement techniques like wavedashing and airdodging, Brawlout adds some extra mechanics seen in other fighting games. The Rage Meter builds up as you both deal and take damage, allowing you either break combos with the Rage Burst or unleash hell with the Rage Mode. The Rage Burst pushes opponents back, breaking their combos and allowing players to create some breathing room at the cost of half their Rage Meter. If the meter fills, you can activate the Rage Mode, increasing the knockback you deal while reducing the amount you take.<br><br>As for modes, Brawlout has all you’d expect from a normal platform fighter and then some. Up to four players can compete in local multiplayer in either timed, stock or team battles. AI opponents are also available if you want to practice your team combos with a friend, or if you need to fill out a free for all. Train with Advanced Tutorials or go in for yourself in challenging Arcade Towers. <br><br>Brawlout’s online suite is suitably robust, with all of the following features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A robust Ranked match system, complete with regional leaderboards<br></li><li>1v1 casual matches for low-stress competition<br></li><li>2-4 player private lobbies where players can practice or mess about to their heart’s content<br></li><li>The Brawlout Network where players can check their fight stats, match history and replays<br></li><li>Brawlout TV which allows for live spectating and watching of specific player replays<br></li><li>Weekly competitive tournaments for those looking to prove their Brawlout skills</li></ul>",
