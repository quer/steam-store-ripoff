Bearing in mind that I described Demon’s Souls as “not that hard” when I reviewed it, this game is harder. Mostly because there isn’t anything you can stock up on to make the road ahead more bearable. No, until you get more characters (there are three to unlock, of which I acquired none), you’re stuck with The Magician’s shotgun and maybe some bombs.”<br>80/99 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://calmdowntom.com/2013/03/99-levels-to-hell-review-pc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Calm Down Tom</a><br>",
