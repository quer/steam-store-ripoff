Multiple game modes, a metric ton of different tactical situations, a MOBA core that creates many possibilities for fun and meaningful gameplay - and even more!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSPACE COMBAT IS FUN <br />\r\nWe don’t really know what «realistic» starships will look like, so we don’t really care. A ship in a game should be fun to look at and fun to ride in, period. We want ships to be weird, plentiful and different - everyone will find one that is suited just for them, both in visual style and the distinct way of playing that comes with every ship. <br />\r\nWe streamlined our gameplay as much as we could, and then we turned the coolness knob up to eleven!",
