The graphics are nicer than in either of these games, but it still manages to implement Minecraft’s world creation and destruction mechanics. That it does so in a truly alien-looking, open-ended fantasy world reminiscent of The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind is icing on the proverbial cake.”<br>Indie RPGs<br><br>“With the constantly changing worlds there is no limit to the wonders that Astral Terra can provide. It’s rare that a game truly leaves me in awe of what they’re doing. Astral Terra is getting to that point. The thought of ever-changing worlds, that I can change on a whim is very intriguing. I hope it lives up to its potential.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://twodashstash.com/2013/11/astral-terra-game-fate-shape-world-hands/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Two Dash Stash</a><br>",
