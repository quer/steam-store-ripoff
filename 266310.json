Join us and our great &amp; enthusiastic community on this journey.  Imagine creating a world that you and your friends come together and play... and creating it could be a matter of minutes with no technical jiggery-pokery needed at all! Of course, you can happily spend hours, days..even weeks creating your masterpiece, the great thing about GameGuru is, you won't be held up by learning strange alien languages or using complex modeling tools.

The fact it's as easy as any in-game level editor is a plus, and unlike level editors, you get to save out what you've made and even sell your game!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/266310/extras/snapshot616.jpg?t=1544228820\" ><br><br>We've created a small game level for you to play and enjoy, which shows you how you might lay out your level, and balance the combat to give the player a challenging experience.

We believe there is nothing on the market which enables you to create and share a 3D game as quickly as GameGuru, thanks to a massive starter collection of assets, our easy drag and drop approach and built-in game logic so you don't need to code it yourself (unless you want to).<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/266310/extras/GG-NewCollage1.png?t=1544228820\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/266310/extras/GG-NewCollage2.png?t=1544228820\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/266310/extras/GG-NewCollage3.png?t=1544228820\" ><br><br>GameGuru offers you an easy yet comprehensive game creation process that is open to non-programmers and designers/artists, or anyone who aspires to become a game creator.
