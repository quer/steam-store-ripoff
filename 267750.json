This has been months in the making and we worked together with a dedicated team of community members who gave us feedback and suggestions. This was also done in our free time and weekends and without any financial gain by a small number of team members as a labor of love, so please excuse any haphazard changes, spelling mistakes or oversights.<br><br>The main thrust of the patch is offer more alternatives to certain dominant combos of race,background, skill and items ('crit-pistols' spring to mind). Also, you can now see your chosen background during game and change it ONCE for pre-existing characters.<br>We hope you enjoy the changes and thank you for support of the game!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Lead your team of Runners to survive a corrupt megacorporation’s intrigue threatening thousands of lives in this new action-strategy game set in the most popular cyberpunk universe of all times – Shadowrun.
