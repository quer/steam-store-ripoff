For he who claims this mighty artefact shall be crowned Dragon King, and all living things will bow to his tyrannical rule or suffer his rage. A new quest for the Crown of Command has begun, more terrifying and dangerous than ever before ... an era of terror and flame is at hand!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Dragon is an epic level expansion, forcing the characters to confront fearsome dragons and deadly challenges throughout the game. Players draw dragon tokens at the start of their turns which commonly results in placing a dragon scale on one of the Draconic Lords. When a Draconic Lord accumulates three dragon scales, he becomes the new Dragon King and one of his dragon scales is placed on the game board. Characters encountering a dragon scale on a space on the board must draw a Dragon Card instead of drawing from the regular Adventure deck. Characters may claim the dragon scale on their space if they kill an Enemy from a Dragon Card. Each dragon scale a character claims increases his fighting prowess against the Draconic Lords and their minions. When a character builds up enough power and courage, he must reach the Crown of Command in the Inner Region and vanquish the Dragon King to win the game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTalisman: The Dragon adds a dangerous new Inner Region for heroes to conquer. The Draconic Lords and their legion of dragons are represented in over 300 new cards and tokens. Six brand-new characters offer fantastic new player experiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAscend the Dragon Tower and confront the Dragon King!",
