Well, why not have 256 unique rhythm patterns organized in a badass map-wheel-gizmo-thing you can interact with to make beats?<br><br>With the BarForm and BeatForm Maps, you have every possible combination of rhythmic patterns in one 4/4 bar neatly organized and grouped together.<br><br>Take these musical examples: You make house music and want a steady Kick pattern. Why not just get that in one click? You want your chorus section to feature hi hats on the off-beats, just one click. You want some driving double-bass in your metal tune, one click.<br><br>The idea is simple: all these patterns exist in your music, you just haven’t used them yet. But when you want to, they’re always only one click away. What’s more, when you’ve created a beat, the Maps help to create slight variations very easily- it’s all about how the patterns are organized in the wheel. So take a look around it, you’ll notice that all the patterns are surrounded by similar patterns.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/268122/extras/barform-map.png?t=1447359708\" >",
