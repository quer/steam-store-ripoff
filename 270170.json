            "reviews": "“Depression Quest hinges on its deeply personal writing style. It feels as though you’re reading someone’s unfiltered mental diary. Depression Quest is uncomfortable in that it feels voyeuristic, but the cramped proximity is how you develop a relationship with the character. It’s why, by the end, I was able to say I understood depression a bit better. It's a window.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/they-made-a-game-that-understands-me/1100-4619/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Giant Bomb</a><br><br>“[Depression Quest] is ‘game’ as communication, comfort and tool of understanding.”<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/14/mostly-indescribable-depression-quest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br><br>“Besides the blues-ridden story, it's just a well-made game overall.
