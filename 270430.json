We went through a lot of changes after the launch and added two fairly large areas that made up the three chapters of this first game.

However, because of the way it initially came out, we did not see the results we wanted and certainly want the game to be what it was supposed to be. We have been working to rebuild this entirely in UE4. We have gone through a lot of changes in the company and this has taken longer than we expected but we are still working to complete and get launched. We are confident we will get the game to where it is an exceptional experience, very engaging, with replay ability because of design.  . In our rebuild in UE4 we are also adding a considerable amount of additional content with several changes to the game play. CITB when done will be what was intended, but dramatically improved, with using the benefits of UE4 and many additions to the game play.
