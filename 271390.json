The model for this vehicle was purchased in 1984 in a series of 40 buses for the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe.<br><br><strong>MB E2H85 </strong>– This series was introduced in 1985 which was the last year of acquisition for the first generation of standard buses. The series featuring eight vehicles was part of a fleet trial with new forms of propulsion. The buses are for example driven by methanol.
