We are the masters of our destinies, Always Sometimes Monsters says – but we can't control other people's lives. That's where it gets tricky.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/06/03/always-sometimes-monsters-review-being-human/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Joystiq</a><br><br>“It's an earnest look at life under tough economic pressure, at love when things don't go according to plan and at a creative career during its shittiest lows. It has a lot to say, and importantly, it speaks from the heart.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/5/5765838/always-sometimes-monsters-review-working-class-hero\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Polygon</a><br><br>“Always Sometimes Monsters isn't the first game to get clever with morality. It's not the first game that's had a few grey areas. It also isn't about either of those. It's about perspective. It's about empathy. It's about who we are and why we do what we do. That narrative is one of contradiction and hypocrisy, because that's what real people are about.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-21-always-sometimes-monsters-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Eurogamer</a><br>",
