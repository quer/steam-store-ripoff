These elite starship captains were trained to accomplish the impossible at whatever cost necessary. Whether employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly. Using these Operatives, the Drox built a starlane system for quick travel amongst the stars, colonized and conquered millions of planets, and ruled the galaxy with an iron grip for over 100,000 years. Eventually realizing their Operatives were a threat, they attempted to assassinate all of them. They failed. The following Galactic Civil War was devastating.<br><br>Thousands of years later, the Drox are extinct, but the secretive Drox Operative guild lives on. They have learned their lesson though: loyalty to any one race is foolish. They now work for whoever can pay. And pay they do!

It IS your job to pick the winning side and maybe even help them conquer the galaxy if you're being nice, more importantly though is to rake in as many credits as possible, well that and build the coolest, deadliest ship in the known universe.

It’s the advancement of the genre that so many people have given up on searching for and Soldak have been providing it for years.”<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/12/21/wot-i-think-drox-operative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br>",
