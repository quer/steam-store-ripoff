This software provides a seamless marriage of 2D and 3D to help you take your sketched ideas to 3D realism. Powerful but easy-to-use 3D design and drafting tools will help you create like seasoned designers and compatibility with other systems will let you share your designs. <br><br>With support for both metric and imperial measurements as well as AutoCAD™, SketchUP, Rhinoceros and other formats to share, <strong>ViaCAD™</strong> is the perfect 3D software to model your ideas. <strong>ViaCAD™</strong> has tools for architectural drawings, mechanical designs, electrical schematics, Do-It-Yourself projects, and much more. <br><br>The addition of <strong>PowerPack LT</strong> allows you to prepare and verify your data for 3D printing. <strong>PowerPack LT</strong> provides a collection of tools designed to increase your productivity within 3D printing and managing CAD data by finding common mistakes with your model before printing. You’ll save time and materials with an overall 3D print check.<br><br>Here are just some of the types of drawings you can create with <strong>ViaCAD™</strong>: <br><br>• 3D models for prototyping with 3D printers <br>• Mechanical parts <br>• DIY projects: from 3D models of game accessories, characters to furniture and work benches <br>• Architectural drawings for drafting documents, room layouts and 3D visualization <br>• Inventions: Easily create 3D models of your concepts <br>• Educational: Drawings and 3D models for science fairs <br>• 3D Models shared at the office <br>• Objects for use in game development studios <br><br>Creating 3D models is easy with <strong>ViaCAD™</strong>, regardless of the design’s complexity. The LogiCursor™ will guide your cursor to help you create drafting documents or even align points in 3D. Editing is as easy as drag and drop with the Gripper™. <br><br>• The LogiCursor™ allows drawing precisely with your mouse and cursor in both 2D and 3D, aligning your cursor with existing points in your drawing. <br>• The Gripper provides click and drag style editing for moving, copying, scaling and rotating parts of the drawing, even faces. <br>• Push/Pull Modeling delivers intuitive editing of your 3D models, allowing 3D surfaces to be editing with your mouse and cursor. <br>• Customizable Grids can be configured as rectangular, polar (circular), and even Isometric. <br>• 26,000 symbols are included to speed up your designing! <br><br><u>Powerful Solid Modeling </u><br><br><strong>ViaCAD™</strong> provides solid modeling technology found in much higher end products.
