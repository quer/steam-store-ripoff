To maintain an excellent service you’ll need to hire workers to sort mail, contract security guards to protect your offices from robberies while also purchasing new vehicles to pick up and deliver mail.<br><br>Once you’ve settled into your first office, you’ll need to look to the future of your company and determine the best plan of action to expand your services.
