It is a classic example of the ‘slam door’ EMUs which were once such a familiar sight across the rail networks of southern England. Extensive 3rd-rail electrification of the Southern Region led to the widespread adoption of these 90mph EMUs, and the 4CIG (British Rail Class 421) was initially introduced on the London-Brighton Line where its multiple doors enabled rapid turnaround of passengers at the many regular station stops .
