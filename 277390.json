With the pinpoint control and endless playability of the best arcade sports experiences, the small team at Action Button Entertainment has invented something wonderful and new in Videoball.”<br>9 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/12/12124516/videoball-review-pc-ps4-playstation-4-xbox-one\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Samit Sarkar, Polygon</a><br><br>“Best of all, it all feels really good. There is a great sense of momentum and movement in Videoball. The sense of acceleration after a dead stop, the slipperiness of trying to reverse direction, the desperate race for a last-second save. Everything has a pleasing kind of grip to it.”<br>9 – <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/review-videoball-374456.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Nic Rowen, Destructoid</a><br><br>“With its distinctively clean retro stylings and deceptively simple set up, Videoball may blindside you with the pace and depth of its gameplay. It's reminiscent of arcade classics, and is easily one of the best multiplayer experiences of the year.”<br>8 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/videoball-review/1900-6416478/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Jason D'Aprile, Gamespot</a><br>",
