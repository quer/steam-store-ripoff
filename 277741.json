Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The DB Class 103 operated by DB, was considered the flagship of the DB fleet for a long period. It was up until 1987 that this locomotive monopolized high speed trains in Germany. It is one of the most powerful conventional electric locomotives ever built, with a one hour rating of 10,400KW or 13,900HP.<br><br>During the 1950s there was a desire to produce an electric locomotive that could operate at speeds up to 200km/h. These were unveiled at the International Transport Fair in Munich in June 1965 as the Class E.03 (which became Class 103.0 when the new numbering system was introduced). Exhibition runs operated the train between Munich and Augsburg, achieving 200km/h on a regular basis. The fastest speed recorded on a Class 103 was 283km/h (176mph).<br><br>Following additional developments, the Class 103 became the backbone of the German Trans Europe Express (TEE) and Intercity lines.<br><br>The long reign of the Class 103 drew to a close in 1987 with the introduction of the new InterCityExpress (ICE) trains, with the Class 103 relegated to local services with more frequent stops.<br><br>A total of 17 Class 103s have been preserved, with 5 of them still in operation, 2 of which are still part of DB's fleet and often used in test runs.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the DB Class 103 TEE on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/222588/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Hamburg Hanover</a> route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2>Three scenarios for the Hamburg Hanover route:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>North Wind<br></li><li>Back from Maintenance Part 1<br></li><li>Back from Maintenance Part 2</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
