S.  While similar in design and purpose to the famed Electro-Motive F40PH diesel, the F40PHL-2 model was custom-built in 1988 for South Florida’s Tri-Rail commuter agency by locomotive remanufacturer Morrison-Knudsen, a firm also known as a construction and engineering company, building such famed infrastructure projects as the Hoover Dam and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.<br><br>The F40PHL-2 was built on the frames of retired Conrail GP40 locomotives, with 3,200 horsepower Electro-Motive 645-series power plants and EMD Dash 2 electronics. The units’ 645-series engine provides power both for traction and for a HEP generator to provide electricity to its commuter consist.. To give the unique diesels a stylish exterior, Morrison-Knudsen used ex-Burlington Northern F45 cabs and carbodies.<br><br>With five F40PHL-2 diesels as motive power, Tri-Rail began operating commuter services on the Miami – West Palm Beach route in January 1989. Initially serving with the F40PHL-2 were Bombardier-built bi-level commuter coaches and cab cars purchased from GO Transit in Canada.  <br><br>The EMD F40PHL-2 for Train Simulator is available in ‘Miami Commuter Rail’ livery and features dynamic braking, ditch lights, and instrument lights. Bombardier bi-level commuter coaches with passenger view are also included, along with a driveable rear cabcar.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Miami on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
