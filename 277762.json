More than 180 examples have been built so far, with the majority manufactured at NREC’s Mount Vernon shop in Southern Illinois.<br><br>The 2,100-horsepower 3GS-21B has found service among a variety of railroads both large and small, with BNSF, Union Pacific, and CSX among its primary operators, along with regional, short line, and belt railroads, as well as the United States Army.<br><br>The NRE 3GS-21B ‘Genset’ for Train Simulator is available in CSX Transportation livery as it operated today, and features in-cab signalling for operations on the NEC: New York-New Haven route. Detailing includes ditch lights, gauge lights, cab lights, platform lights and a digital speedometer, with a characteristic start-up and shut-down of the appropriate gensets while in use to meet power demand. Also included are centrebeam flat wagons with dynamic lumber loads.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the CSX 3GS-21B ‘Genset’ on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
