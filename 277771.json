The design was a move towards modernity, with features such as a self-cleaning smokebox and electric lighting prominent in the out-shopped locomotives. <br><br>The class was designed for express passenger work and all locomotives were initially turned out in LNER’s apple green livery, with repainting into British Railways’ Brunswick green livery beginning in 1949. <br><br>With the exception of the first A2 Class to enter service, all locomotive names followed LNER’s tradition of using famous racehorse names – <i>Blue Peter III</i> was a racehorse owned by Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Roseberry, which in 1939 won races including the Epsom Derby and the 2000 Guineas.<br><br><i>Blue Peter</i> served on the mainline until 31 December 1966, two years before the end of British steam, and put into storage. However, in 1968 the locomotive was purchased by enthusiast Geoff Drury and a campaign for its restoration was launched on the famous British children’s television programme and locomotive-namesake <i>Blue Peter</i>.<br><br>The locomotive is now owned by the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust and awaiting restoration and renewal of its mainline boiler certificate at the famous Barrow Hill Roundhouse in Derbyshire, before returning back to mainline standard.<br><br>The Peppercorn Class A2 <i>Blue Peter</i> for Train Simulator recreates the famous locomotive in its current Brunswick Green livery with British Railways on the tender sides and blue-faced nameplates, as it ran between 1996 and 2001.
