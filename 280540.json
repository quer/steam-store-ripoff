This game has an undeniable charm that oozes from the fantastic pixel art, silly wording, and simple but tough strategy elements. As long as you’re willing to go broke a few times, there’s tons of fun to be had while playing. Go forth and exterminate ghosts!”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://cliqist.com/2014/02/16/review-ghostcontrol-inc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >cliQist</a><br><br>“[...] GhostControl, Inc is an awesome game! After all, who hasn’t watched Ghostbusters, and wanted to start a business like that? In many ways, it gives players enough rope with which to hang themselves, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. I can’t recommend it more highly! [...] I can easily see myself coming back to it to go farther with the game, or start a new one on a higher difficulty setting.
