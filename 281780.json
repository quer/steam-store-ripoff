Gabe and I played it for hours last weekend and had a great time. It’s got some puzzle elements that you can choose to engage with if you want to but you can also just dig. It’s a very relaxing game and you can lose a couple hours to it wasy without even noticing.”<br>- – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/2013/11/21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Tycho, Penny Arcade</a><br>",
