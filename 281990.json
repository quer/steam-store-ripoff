Both games tickle the part of my brain that wants every battle to have some greater context, every move I make to be part of a larger narrative. Stellaris manages to do this without history to lean on, though, and does so with aplomb.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/stellaris-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PCGamesN</a><br><br>“Stellaris is easy to comprehend and exciting to execute, which is a perfect combination for a genre notoriously difficult to break into.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-stellaris-358688.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br><br>“Right now, Stellaris is a very good space-based strategy game, but a few months down the road, it could evolve into a fantastic one”<br>8.2/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/stellaris/review/article-1659.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hooked Gamers</a><br>",
