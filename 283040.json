Mitigate the combat’s result with a 2d6 (one for damages and the other for effects). Favor one attribute when you level up. Unlock and collect sets of dice (common/uncommon/rare/epic), but Beware!

And do not let the cute graphics fool you. This game will kill you. :)  This is simply a MUST buy.”<br>10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.desura.com/games/paper-dungeons/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VladVoivode</a><br><br>“A topdown turn based RPG that takes me back to my childhood days of playing Hero Quest with my friends. Fun graphical style and random dice mechanic make it enjoyable to play and a different experience every time. There is plenty of content to keep you occupied with game modes, classes, dice sets, and difficulty levels to unlock. 125+ basic levels and the ability to create and share your own dungeons with other players online.”<br>9 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.desura.com/games/paper-dungeons/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >dangergerbil</a><br><br>“Turned the game on this morning at 8am, what felt like 5 minutes later was actually 4 hours and 50 minutes, havent had that happen for a long time.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.desura.com/games/paper-dungeons/page/5#comments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >EzPzJoystiq</a><br>",
