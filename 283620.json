It was first described as such in 1949 and already appeared on the 1947 Underground Map. It had not been built as a separate line, but was merged from different sections of the Metropolitan Line and the District Line.

Whilst the player models are not as fantastic as you might want, and there are a few small issues here and there, it is one of the best simulators out so far this year 4/5.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamercast.net/world-subways-london-underground-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.gamercast.net/world-subways-london-underground-review</a><br>",
