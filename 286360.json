The voice acting and soundtrack is amongst the best I’ve heard in a long time – which is all the more impressive as this game is made by a small Italian company most of you reading this have never heard of.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://diehardgamefan.com/2012/03/05/review-shadows-on-the-vatican-act-i-greed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Diehard Game Fan</a><br><br>“It’s definitely a very good title to play not only for the adventure games lovers, but even for who is not into this genre, since it features the simplicity of a very intuitive technical compartment, cleverly mixed with an intricate and worthy plot, which prefigures a compelling ending since the beginning.
