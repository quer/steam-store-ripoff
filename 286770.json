            "reviews": "“Shadow Ops begins roughly three-quarters of the way through the story and then works its way backwards after letting you witness a truly horrific moment. The story itself is pretty much standard Hollywood fluff, so expect betrayals and some stiff banter in the cut-scenes. Shadow Ops makes use of standard first-person shooting techniques, but offers a very helpful lean function that actually is something other developers should rip off. Yes, lean has been used before, but it's very effective and even vital in ShOps.”<br>7/10 – <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/22/shadow-ops-red-mercury-review?page=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN</a><br><br>“General movement is easy enough, and thankfully the standard control layout you would expect in a first person shooter is here. The action is fast paced, and you will have to keep on your heels to succeed in completing the missions, so a simplified control scheme is a godsend.”<br>7/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamershell.com/pc/shadow_ops_red_mercury/review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamesHell</a><br><br>“If you’re looking for a decent shooter you’ve come to the right place. All of the sounds are superb and the audio separation comes through very clearly. To complement the gunfire and chaos is a heart thumping soundtrack that helps convey the situation. It goes for a sort of middle eastern chant that was prevalent all throughout movies like Black Hawk Down and Gladiator and it works really well here.”<br>6.4/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/Shadow-Ops-Red-Mercury/Item577.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gaming Nexus</a><br>",
