Old-school fans and platformer newcomers alike will find Rex Rocket an enjoyable and rewarding experience thanks to one-of-a-kind handmade pixel art that makes up over 100 handcrafted levels connected in an expansive starship-- each filled with a wide variety of puzzles, enemies, hazards and bosses. An original chiptunes soundtrack by Saskrotch, captivating setting filled with quirky characters, and ability to choose the gender of your hero is only a handful of the many awesome features in the game.<br><br>Set in Earth's distant future, Rex Rocket alludes to the classic conflict of Man vs. Machine. You play as either Captain Rexford or Rexanna, a former war hero who now transports scientists throughout the universe in the epic Star Ship-- S.S. Montana. The game begins on Earth as the crew prepares for another routine mission for the Council of Science that involves transplanting bio-engineered Terra-Oozlings onto an uninhabited planet on the other side of the galaxy. While the ship's crew are in cryo-sleep, all heck breaks loose when the dangerous specimens escape and cause the ship's main AI computer to go insane.
