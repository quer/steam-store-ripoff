She is a kind-hearted and optimistic girl, but cursed with poverty. She has immense bad luck when it comes to money, constantly destroying things around her and as a result, has accumulated endless amounts of debt. Her dream is to become rich as an alchemist, and she often fantasizes about creating unlimited gold through alchemy.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/289060/extras/gladys.png?t=1581107659\" ><br><strong>Gladys</strong><br>Her father is a Palian noble and her mother is from a big Austian family. With such an outstanding family heritage, she came to Austia with her personal maid Winnie and was raised by her grandmother. She grew up alongside Winnie and Misty.

He learned from a blacksmith during childhood and become proficient himself at a young age. Yet he chose to become a knight once he reached adulthood.
