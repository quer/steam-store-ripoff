There’s an in depth crafting system, a range of building features, and free terraforming across the map - meaning you can build your own house anywhere in the world. Team up with your friends and build a village or city and repel attacks by other players who want to ransack your lands! <br><br>The unique combat system is non-target and physics-based; the direction of your attack depends on mouse movement. Basic movements and directional attacks can be combined to create deadly combos with special harmful effects. Battle formations are also a new way to collaborate and control the situation on the battlefield with your fighting team. Co-operation and a good strategy within a formation will help you prevail against the enemy.<br><br>Everything is tweakable and unique to you, including how your character progresses. The skill and stat cap system allows you to design a character molded to fit your style perfectly, for example. Even alchemy is unique; all recipes are randomized for each character thus the only way to learn is by experimentation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><strong>Unique Features:</strong> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Free Terraforming &amp; Tunnel Building.</strong> 100% free terraforming and tunnel building means you can dig tunnels, mines and moats and expand them in all dimensions barely without limit!
