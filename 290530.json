Asymmetrical co-op allows one player to take the role of the spy while a friend provides overwatch and assistance as the hacker, and unravel a post-Cold War espionage conspiracy.<br><br>The year is 1996, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A string of accidents and murders gone mostly unnoticed by the public eye have put the world of international espionage on high alert - veteran Cold War operatives from both sides of the former Iron Curtain are being assassinated around the globe. High-ranking officials of the CIA and the FSB secretly establish a joint task force to investigate the leaks. Codenamed The Kingbridge Executive, the group is funded with whatever money could be skimmed off of official projects and staffed by whoever could be spared from official operations.

As the Spy, you will experience Clandestine as a 3rd person game, controlling the movements and actions of Katya in the game world. Katya is the boots on the ground, armed with weapons and gadgets that you can use to stay alive and evade your opponents. Katya is also well trained in hand-to-hand combat, and can use lethal or non-lethal stealth takedowns to take down enemies, leaving behind as little evidence as possible. During the mission, it also falls to the Spy to search for dossiers and intel to unlock new equipment and software for subsequent missions.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/290530/extras/spy_side616.png?t=1455615931\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Playing as the Hacker</h2><br>Martin operates in an entirely different way than the spy, which is reflected in the hacker player's interface and game mechanics.

By default, the Camera Feed displays the <i>Operative Camera</i> (a hidden camera worn by Katya), but you can also jump into surveillance cameras on the <i>Tactical Map</i> (see below) to look through them and scout the levels for enemies and other threats.

Hackers must be mindful of the Network Admin, an enemy AI which searches for changes in the Network and tries to correct them.
