With &quot;party&quot; RPGs, this game is related not only as of the management of a team of characters but also to an advanced quest system, a good choice of classes and weapons with an extensive set of characteristics.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.lki.ru/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >&quot;Лучшие компьютерные игры&quot;</a><br><br>“Strange as it may seem, but you will be inspired by the story of <strong>X-TEAM</strong>. The guileless plot, the long-familiar narrative about the evil aliens, &quot;the planet was unable to oppose the enemy&quot; is a wonderful backdrop for a turbulent political thriller. Intrigues, secrets, betrayals, adventures and amazing disclosures.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://stopgame.ru/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >StopGame</a><br><br>“The authors came up with a very fascinating plot: here there are many diverse characters with their skeletons in the closet, and intrigue, and unexpected plot twists. Moreover, there is a real, not imaginary, nonlinearity: at a certain moment, you must make a difficult moral choice, after which the plot will be divided into two independent branches. In addition, there is everything for a &quot;real manchkin&quot;. There are enough opportunities for comfortable character leveling: in addition to the main quests and the main enemies, you can always be distracted to explore the territory, arrange the genocide of the local fauna and find a couple of backpacks with valuable loot.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.playground.ru/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PlayGround</a><br>",
