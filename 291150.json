We use our Discord server to set up games and discuss balance. If you would like to start up a game, you can just click the &quot;Play the Game!&quot; button on the lobby main screen to see if the servers are currently populated, or simply join Discord and ask if anyone is up for a game. The answer is usually yes. To update to the latest version, all you need to do is join a server. The Launcher will download everything you need automatically. Steam already comes with the core game files and maps, but game updates are handled upon launch of the lobby. Updates happen early, often, and they are usually only a few kb in size.</p><br><h1>Join us on Discord!</h1><p><strong>Check out our Discord Server!:</strong> <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.me/evolutionrts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://discord.me/evolutionrts</a><br><br>Here you can get help, instruction, and find people to play with!</p><br><h1>Linux Users</h1><p><strong>libsdl2-dev package is required!</strong><br><strong>libopenal package is required!</strong><br><strong>xterm package is required!</strong><br><br>sudo apt-get update<br>sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev<br>sudo apt-get install libopenal<br>sudo apt-get install xterm</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Evolution RTS</strong></h2> is a free an Open Source RTS game designed using the Spring Engine. It has been in development for many years and receives updates often. Its gameplay is designed specifically to appeal to gamers of all skill levels. The gameplay is designed around the use of unit groups, and the mixture of your unit group often will determine how successful you are in battle, as opposed to churning out hundreds of the same unit continually.<br><br>The economy and teching system is easy to learn and use. The game itself supplies many tools that make managing your economy easier so that you can focus more on crushing your enemy than of playing simcity in your base. Units interact using realistic physics and varied terrain (you can actually micro units in order to dodge projectiles!).<br><br>Below is a very short list of the features that Evolution RTS has to offer:<br><br><strong>Realistic Physics</strong><br>Projectiles and units use a realistic physics system which allow for unprecedented control and gameplay. Micro your units to avoid projectiles. Hide behind terrain for cover.<br><br><strong>Epic and Macro scales</strong><br>Control the battlefield and a level that feels the most comfortable to you, whether zoomed in controlling individual units, zoomed out viewing the entire map and issuing orders on a macro scale, or somewhere in between! You are in complete control!<br><br><strong>Fine tuning controls for builders</strong><br>Set builders on repeat so that they repeat the orders you give infinitely until they die. Adjust builder priority in order to control the amount of resources allocated to that specific builder’s construction project.<br><br><strong>Unique Cover System allows you to easily set up ambushes</strong><br>Hide your army in rocks and foilage completely undetected and lie in wait to ambush your enemy!<br><br><strong>Gameplay geared towards casual gamers in addition to hardcore rts fans, as opposed to only being fun to play at the higher levels</strong><br>Gameplay designed around being easy to learn yet hard to master. As a newbie you can be up and running in no time, and the gameplay ensures that just because you are new, you aren’t necessarily at a huge disadvantage.<br><br><strong>Hundreds of units at once</strong><br>The Spring Engine allows for hundreds or thousands of units to be beating the daylights out of each other all at once. Gameplay scales seamlessly to fit!<br><br><strong>Unique unit abilities</strong><br>Discover units with special abilities, such as the ORB with it’s incredible area healing abilities, or the Overseer with it’s EMP ability!<br><br><strong>Simple Economy</strong><br>The economy is designed to be easy to learn, and use. There are only two resources in the game; Energy and Metal. Energy is used for utility purposes such as unit ammunition, powering shields, and building nuclear missiles, whereas metal is used to construct structures and units.
