They’re beautiful, in a nightmarish sort of way, and you’ll be seeing them in your head long after you stop playing.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://yhoo.it/1iEZ6CI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Games in Asia</a><br><br>“You may be surprised (and more than a little pleased) to learn that there’s not a single mention of the zombie apocalypse. The dead remain inanimate, safely ensconced six feet under. Motte Island has chosen a far great adversary for you to contend with, one we’re sure will strike fear into your hearts.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.laptopzombie.co.uk/news/motte-island.aspx#.UdwjL6wn1Jc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >LaptopZombie</a><br>",
