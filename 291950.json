Fun graphical style and random dice mechanic make it enjoyable to play and a different experience every time. There is plenty of content to keep you occupied with game modes, classes, dice sets, and difficulty levels to unlock. 125+ basic levels and the ability to create and share your own dungeons with other players online.”<br>9 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.desura.com/games/paper-dungeons/reviews\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >dangergerbil</a><br><br>“Turned the game on this morning at 8am, what felt like 5 minutes later was actually 4 hours and 50 minutes, haven’t had that happen for a long time.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.desura.com/games/paper-dungeons/page/5#comments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >EzPzJoystiq</a><br>",
