            "short_description": "Elegant and minimal, Duet asks players simply to navigate two orbiting spheres past an increasingly complex maze of falling obstacles. As the difficulty increases, the tension mounts, and a peculiar narrative unfolds.",

            "reviews": "“I’ve been more frustrated by Duet than by any other game this year; on the flip side, few other games are as fun when you succeed. The game has a clever premise: instead of controlling one character, you control two—little dots that are linked together, occupying opposite spots on a single circle. Move a character right, and the other moves left.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/12/the-year-in-elegant-iphone-games.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The New Yorker</a><br><br>“Duet is a game of few parts, but each one of those parts fits perfectly with the rest. It feels as designed as a raindrop, and just as perfect.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/3/5270476/duet-my-game-of-the-year-why-minimalist-games-often-ignored-lists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Polygon</a><br><br>“Duet does what the best video games do. It introduces an abstract idea, a fabricated set of simple systems, then it gives you a set of meaningless obstacles to overcome using those systems. But somewhere — in-between those two ideas — a weird magic trick. I am finding it very difficult to stop playing Duet because playing Duet feels really, really good.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/10/duet-and-wasted-time-well-spent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kotaku Australia</a><br>",
