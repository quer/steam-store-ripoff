Catering to the expert and fledgling producer, the BigTone Pack provides a characteristic set of building blocks for your next electronic production.

It is very important for the user to check the name, especially what's within the brackets, as that is mostly very important, to bring the sound to life. also there's the information if the sound mandatorily has to be played back by the host in order for some functions to work correctly.<br><br>I have no concrete plan on how to incorporate the sounds into a song - the sound creatively triggers me and leads me the way. your own imagination tells you naturally, what to do with it, and that's different for each person. so there' s no general way to go on this. at least not one i could possibly propose.<br><br><strong>Q:</strong> Where do you like to start when working on a new track?<br><br><strong>A:</strong> It depends.
