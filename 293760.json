As well as an Open Beta of the Car and Engine design aspects of Automation built in Unreal Engine 4, giving major improvements in graphical quality, performance, playability and UI Design.<br><br>Currently we're hard at work on a new, improved, Unreal Engine based Campaign mode, coming soon!<br><br>Read the Early Access description for a full overview of what is finished so far, and check out out  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/AutomationGame\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://www.youtube.com/user/AutomationGame</a> for regular development news updates -</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>**NEW UPDATE**</strong><strong>Drive Your Automation Cars In BeamNG.drive!</strong></h2><br><br>Automation will allow the player to become an armchair CEO - to build their own car company from the ground up. Create and run anything from a boutique supercar manufacturer to a mass-market multinational mogul. With powerful tools like the Engine Designer, the player can create cars and their engines in mind-boggling detail. <br><br>The grand campaign will start in the year 1946 and run until 2020, with the main goal being to build a successful, renowned car company from scratch. All types of car manufacturers can be led to success if managed properly; building the right image over the years is key. The player’s tasks are to design engines and cars, to manage factories, production, Research and Development, as well as advertising campaigns. In game, time advances at the pace the player chooses and pauses automatically for events and occurrences. <br><br>Automation is comprised of three major game components - the Engine Designer, the Car Designer and the Company Manager. These components are naturally strung together by the game’s goals, made to be user-friendly and intuitive to use. A multitude of tutorial missions, videos, and descriptive texts help car novices become experts. Almost infinite options give the player all the creative freedom to create unique cars with vastly different engines. <br><br><br>Automation also features an in-game exporter which allows you to export and drive your vehicles in BeamNG.drive. The exporter is simple to use: design your car and engine in Automation, tune them to your liking, hit the export button, start up BeamNG.drive and your new car is right there in the vehicle list, with the aesthetics as well as many of the fine engineering and performance details of your car design simulated accurately<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>KEY PLANNED FEATURES FOR THE COMPLETED GAME: </strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Extremely Deep, Technical, Creative – Experience unheard-of creative freedom in a highly technical, realistic gameplay experience revolving around building a car company from scratch.
