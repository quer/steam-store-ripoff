As one of the original titles in the popular MacVenture series that went on to be celebrated on the NES, GBC, and Nintendo 64, <strong>Shadowgate</strong> quickly endeared players with its fantastic atmospheric soundtrack, perilous locations to progress through, countless puzzles to solve, and more ways to gruesomely die than gamers previously thought possible. Thrust into the role of &quot;The Seed of Prophecy,&quot; players travel deep into the living castle, in hopes of defeating the evil that dwells within – the dreaded Warlock Lord. <br><br>Now, nearly 30 years after the original version haunted Mac and NES gamers, the original development team behind that timeless classic is back with a full re-imagining of the original <strong>Shadowgate</strong>. Much more than a port, the team at Zojoi has painstakingly redesigned the game from the ground up, adding in tons of new mind-bending puzzles, lots of new rooms with stunning hand-painted 2D graphical detail, and more objects to interact with and help you along your quest. <br><br>Decide how YOU want to play this new, re-imagined <strong>Shadowgate</strong>! Want the modern adventure experience? Use the wheel-based icon command system. Want the retro experience? Employ the Classic command system and turn on the retro graphics, soundtrack, text box, and room transitions. Want a more cinematic experience? Switch to Immersive mode by auto-hiding the UI and using customizable hotkeys to explore the castle. Or mix and match the options to satisfy your play style.
