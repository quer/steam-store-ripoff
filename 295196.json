The design of the 1100 series was based on the Swiss SBB Ce 6/8 II but with some differences to avoid complications, such as the four connecting rods to the drive wheels from the motors mounted in each crocodile nose. The first seven locomotives, numbered as 1100, were delivered in 1923/24 with the remaining nine locomotives, which were stronger and slightly heavier were numbered 1100.1, followed in 1925/26.<br><br>Initially all of the locomotives were based in Innsbruck but were later moved to Salzburg where they operated over the Arlberg and Tauernbahn, displacing the 1670 series as they proved their reliability and effectiveness. In 1938, all locomotives were taken over by the German Reichsbahn and reclassified as E 89 and E 89.1 until 1953 when they were again reclassified under the newly renamed OBB to 1089 and 1189 following refurbishment and upgrade work.<br><br>Despite the locomotives only delivering a maximum continuous output of 1740kW (2300hp) they are able to propel trains weighing several-hundred tons, on top of their 116-ton weight, to their top speed of 75km/h (47mph).<br><br>Sadly, only one operating example of the locomotive survived into preservation, ÖBB 1189.02, while three non-operating examples were retained. Two were kept as museum exhibits: 1089.06 at the Sinsheim Auto &amp; Technik Museum and 1189.05 at the Strasshof Railway Museum.
