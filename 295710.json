            "reviews": "“The brutality of Darkwind is the most appealing thing about it. Your team ages: at 30 their stats start dropping, at 40 their skills follow. You'll give them nicknames, train them, get attached to them, maybe even unlock specialities such as Engine Tuner or Negotiator, and then they'll die.”<br>80% – <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer Magazine</a><br><br>“Dark Wind's actual gameplay is phenomenal. If you like the sound of turn based tactical car combat this is your new holy grail. The physics of car movement, drifting, changing how a car performs offroad and on tarmac, a variety of physics related to each individual car ... I mean, it's all here.”<br>90% – Game Tunnel<br><br>“MMORPGs get repetitive to me ... Grinding drives me crazy with rage. How many rat-equivalents do you need to smack around before you get to go beat up something else? I think this is a natural state, though, as the game has to appeal to all levels, from the beginner to the seasoned veteran ... With the addition of scouting between cities, and frequent content injections, Darkwind has a lot to do and see in-game no matter the skill level of the player or the composition of the gang. This is a breath of fresh air in what I consider a very stale and one-sided genre of gameplay, where even the behemoth in the market seems destined for repetition.”<br>7.5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=964\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Inside Mac Games</a><br>",
