Torsos of young children ripped open, their bodies hung like criminals; blood filled pools in the Cistern house rotting bodies, throats cut, fingers missing.

Become the the high Priest who can be counted on to cast spells to protect the people of Istanbul or choose to be the Sorcerer and release your inner demon fueling your thirst for destruction.<br><br>The Soldier; fierce, strong, and none better with a blade.  Protecting people is your Knightly duty, with your feminine intuition &amp; compassionate heart leading you to do the right thing for the kingdom.  But perhaps you would rather seek to unlock the dark side and become the Assassin.
