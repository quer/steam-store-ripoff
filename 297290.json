How are your crime solving skills going!?<br>Argh... who are we kidding... Look, it has been a long time and this patch is 2 years too late, we know, ok!? No more excuses, here are the patch notes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>English revision.</strong> Somebody took the time to sit down and review it. Mistakes were corrected, bad jokes were reviewed and some other oddities cleaned. STILL. There might be a few mistakes hidden somewhere. Please let us know and we will fix it asap. We also promise to hire a professional team to translate the next game we release.<br></li><li> <strong>Steam Cloud.</strong> We now support it. Well, it worked on our end so it should work on yours, right?<br></li><li> <strong>Screenshots.</strong> They work! How amazing is that? It was such a silly thing that we are ashamed to even talk about it.<br></li><li> <strong>Bugs squashed.</strong> Lot's of them. We read all of the complaints, put the game on a lot of people hands, and tested it all again. Let's hope that final interview thing and the Stand Up Clown thing doesn't pop up again.</li></ul><br>Finally we need to let you know that we will be on top of things so, if you see any other issues, please let us know.<br><br>Thanks for the support and to everyone who helped us out.<br>And if you haven't yet left us a review, please consider taking some time to write a few words, Robot Clown loves reviews!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Detective Case and Clown Bot in: Murder in the Hotel Lisbon</strong><br><br>Murder in the Hotel Lisbon is a videogame inspired by the classic point and click adventures from the 80’s and 90’s. It adopts these eras distinctive design and it is built using only the pixel art technique. The game itself runs at a native resolution of 256x192, the same resolution used by the old ZX Spectrum 48k and most recently by the Nintendo DS. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/297290/extras/steam_descriptionEN.png?t=1547394171\" ><br><br><strong>Synopsis: </strong><br>A strange murder has occurred in the Hotel Lisbon, a man committed suicide with 14 stabs to the back while at the same time he peacefully drank his coffee. <br>This case with contradictory facts was too complex for Policeman Garcia to solve, so he decided to hire the only detective duo in town capable of solving it: the mythical Detective Case and the unmistakable Clown Bot. <br>Together, they will solve a network of love relations so complex and so intricate, that it would take at least 14 clairvoyants, 5 apocalyptic sect prophets who can predict the end of the world and 3 of those gypsies that can read the palm of your hand just to guess the final outcome. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/297290/extras/screenshot_anime.jpg?t=1547394171\" ><br><br><strong>Characters: </strong><br>With the mythical Detective Case, also known as the world worst detective, a man so rough and rude that his witnesses would rather be run over by a slow moving freight train than to be questioned by him. <br>And the hilarious Clown Bot who, although he works as a Detective Case’s sidekick, he hopes in reality that one day he will get a job as a circus clown. Unfortunately, and no matter how many applications he sends, no circus will ever accept a clown that is afraid of children. He never sleeps, so besides working by day as a sidekick, he also works by night as a stand-up comedian in a local bar. People say that he is a joke machine. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/297290/extras/steam_characters.png?t=1547394171\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features</h2>Murder in the Hotel Lisbon has THOUSANDS of key features!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A point and click graphic adventure game. <br></li><li>Play as Detective Case and Clown Bot. <br></li><li>Search for clues and interview witnesses. <br></li><li>Take a rest, have a nap. <br></li><li>Solve the murder in the Hotel Lisbon. <br></li><li>Includes 3 additional cases.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Steam release:</h2>The release on the Steam platform includes many Steam updates and Steam extra features only found here on Steam!
