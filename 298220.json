You will use these and the resources of the planet itself to create your own light, heat, water, air and food. <br><br>•The second phase is exploration of the planet itself: where are the other ships? Who shot you down in the first place? You will do so in a beautiful and realistically rendered 3D environment complete with dynamic interactions of light, heat, day/night cycles, and Martian geology and volcanology. <br><br>•Third and most challenging, you need to transform the lifeless, desolate and frozen wasteland into a new home for Mankind. You will do this from scratch, using constructed tools, machinery, and Earth born bacteria and plant life carefully nurtured and strategically placed. You will create a complete atmosphere, hydrosphere, and a complex biosphere - step by agonizing step - as you fight to stave off the cold, the hunger, and the loneliness of a world that will kill you without a thought, with no one to hear you scream.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Save Earth, terraform Mars.</strong></h2>",
