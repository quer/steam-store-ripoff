Gatling laser guided rocket launchers, bear teleporters and singularity cannons are just the beginning. All this customization isn’t just for show, either. Different weapon and character builds allow for a huge range of effective playstyles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TACTICAL DEPTH</h2>The space skeleton armada is cunning and merciless – flanking, sniping, cloaking and teleporting are just a few of the tricks the AI is capable of. However, if you learn their tactics you can use your enemies weapons against them. All attacks have full friendly fire, and exceptional players can annihilate entire fleets by tricking them into shooting each other.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MASSIVE BOSSES</h2>After obliterating enough regular enemies, you’ll have to face down screen filling deathmachines like the Killdozer, Bullet Devil and Terror Fortress Omega.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PRESS QUOTES</h2>&quot;what’s interesting about the game: the variety of its enemies, the manner in which you can manipulate its AI, and that it has singleplayer as well as 8-player coop.&quot;<br>- Graham Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun<br><br>&quot;A beautiful shoot em up with super fast paced and challenging combat.&quot;<br>- Nick Puleo, Co-Optimus<br><br>&quot;Want to be a teleporting, mine dropping, laser blade wielding cyberdragon?
