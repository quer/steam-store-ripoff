These are not standard enemy types like &quot;flying&quot; or standard tower types like &quot;long range and slow&quot;--you haven't seen these before in other tower defense games. The game also comes with a level editor, with Steam Workshop support, and is pre-packaged with an extra 62 levels created by fans.<br><br>Note: The game was first released on May 31, 2007, and was updated with new content in 2009, and then again significantly improved for its Steam release in August 2015.",

The existentialist storyline is not only compelling and thoughtful, but it's probably the best explanation for &quot;turret defense&quot; gameplay I've seen yet.”<br>9 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123035324/http://gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Derek Yu, Game Tunnel</a><br><br>“The brief text sequences between levels carries the story--to fight in &quot;pathspace,&quot; you have foregone your body and normal existence, and the concerns of the people who are sworn to defend seem increasingly irrelevant to you, in this very different existence. I typically think this kind of backstory is irrelevant (and often poorly written), but here it's almost haunting--nicely done.”<br>10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123035324/http://gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Greg Costikyan, Game Tunnel</a><br>",
