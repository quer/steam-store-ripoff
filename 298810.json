With such evocative titles as “Battle music,” “Exploration music,” etc., it is often placed into the game piecemeal wherever it happens to &quot;sound good&quot;.<br><br>Jeremy Soule has always approached his games with a keen eye, and a steady determination to advance the role that music plays. His scores are spellbinding, embodying the spirit of whatever work he is contributing to, and his standards are impeccable.<br><br>We approached the score for CONSORTIUM in much the same way one would a film. The non-linear and branching nature of the game means that players will experience the story in their own way, from their perspective.  Jeremy’s music will always be there, complimenting what you’re doing, playing with your emotions. There are musical foreshadowing and powerful thematic moments that will help you to interpret the events and unravel the mystery.
