The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.

These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail.<br><br><strong>Revamped Combat System:</strong> The <i>Dragonfall</i> combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.<br><br><strong>Redesigned Interface:</strong> The <i>Dragonfall</i> in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.<br><br><strong>Customize Your Team:</strong> Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities.
