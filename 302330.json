I loved this game!”<br />\r\n100 – Techtite<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“The premise behind Mean Streets is simple. What can be better than a modern sci-fi story like Blade Runner or an old-fashioned Agatha Christy murder mystery? The answer is obvious—the two combined! Take a post nuclear war Earth, a classic detective noir, a mysterious foe, a femme fatale, and an evil plot to destroy mankind; mix the ingredients, stir, and voila, you have a fantastic adventure game called Mean Streets!”<br />\r\n80 – Adventure Classic Gaming<br />\r\n",
