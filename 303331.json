In roleplaying games, one player takes on the role of the gamemaster (GM), while the other player(s) assume the roles of player characters (PCs) in the game. The gamemaster also acts out the roles of characters who aren’t being guided by players: these are called non-player characters (NPCs).<br><br>From its origin, <i>Basic Roleplaying</i> was designed to be intuitive and easy to play. Character attributes follow a 3D6 curve, and the other Basic Roleplaying mechanics are even simpler. Virtually all rolls determining success or failure of a task are determined via the roll of percentile dice. This means that there’s less fiddling with dice of different types, and the concept of a percentile chance of success is extremely easy for beginners and experienced players to grasp. There aren’t many easier ways to say a character has a 70% chance of succeeding at an activity.<br><br>The core virtues of the system are as evident today as they were when it was first introduced. Primary characteristics of <i>Basic Roleplaying</i> that have emerged from decades of play, across many different varieties of the system are as follows:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The system is remarkably friendly to newcomers. It is easy to describe the basics of the game system, and the percentile mechanics, to non-gamers.<br></li><li>Players of other game systems often find Basic Roleplaying to be much less mechanistic and less of a barrier to the actual act of roleplaying. Less time spent on game systems usually equals more time available for roleplaying and thinking “in character.”<br></li><li>Most of the information players need to know is present on their character sheets.<br></li><li>Characters tend to evolve based on practicing the skills they use the most. They do not arbitrarily gain experience in skills and qualities based on ephemeral elements such as levels or experience ranks.<br></li><li>Combat can be very quick and deadly, and often the deciding blow in a conflict is the one to land first.<br></li><li>Basic Roleplaying is remarkably modular: levels of complexity can be added or removed as needed, and the core system works equally well with considerable detail as it does with a minimal amount of rules.<br></li><li>The internal consistency of Basic Roleplaying allows for rules judgments to be made rapidly and with little searching through the rulebook for special cases.<br></li><li>This book represents a first for Basic Roleplaying—a system complete in one book, without a defined setting.
