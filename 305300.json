Harland played a 1960s Ludwig drum set, a range of classic snare drums and a palette of custom Zildjian cymbals, while Hunter played his seven-string guitar into separate guitar and bass amplifiers for discrete tone.<br><br>Multiple Grammy-nominated drummer Eric Harland is widely considered to be among the leading young drummers worldwide. Charlie Hunter is among the most unique musicians alive, performing rhythm and lead guitar parts as well as bass lines simultaneously. Both Harland and Hunter have enjoyed careers performing and recording with a veritable “who’s who” of jazz, pop, and other contemporary music personalities including D'Angelo, McCoy Tyner, Norah Jones, Frank Ocean and Mos Def.",
