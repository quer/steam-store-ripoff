Adam Apple, also known as Fantabulous, creates energy shields with ease, has punched thugs into submission, soars through the air with ease and attempts to seduce everyone he meets. The little tinker would seduce a death ray into submission if he thought it would respond to his dubious charms.”<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/07/19/the-legend-ascends-heroes-rise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>“Sometimes, gamebooks offer blind choices, force illogical decisions, or allow for strategic decision making but not moral conundrums. Heroes Rise does a great job with the design and writing of its decision points. Some are pure action and strategy, but most are focused on who you are as a hero (or, potentially, a villain) and how you will relate to those around you.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"http://toucharcade.com/2012/08/17/heroes-rise-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >TouchArcade</a><br><br>“it delivers a lengthy and surprisingly action-packed tale with memorable characters, dramatic moments, and some very cool scenes to play your part in.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/archives/2012/07/heroes_rise_the_prodigy.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >JayIsGames</a><br>",
