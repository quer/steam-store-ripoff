Embark on a journey full of conspiracies, trickery and secrets where you can never tell a friend from foe.<br><br>In the beginning of each game you are assigned one of the 11 readymade characters at random. Each character has their own unique agenda to pursue, as well as a randomized goal to strive for. Fulfilling your objectives might not be as easy as it seems though: as everyone else has their own secrets, some of the people aboard might not be as willing to co-operate as you would like. It is up to you to use your cunning, wits and social skills to get what you want and avoid spilling your own secrets.<br><br>The scenarios are always multiplayer and require a minimum of 4 players, which means that every character you see is played by a real person. This also means completing quests always requires freeform chatting and interaction with the other characters. <br><br>Velvet Sundown is based on the Dramagame engine developed by the Finnish game developer Tribe Studios Ltd.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The first entertainment title ever to use revolutionary <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.dramagame.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Dramagame</a> mechanics and technology<br></li><li>Endless replayability: players' actions affect how each scenario plays out, so every session is truly unique<br></li><li>Uses high-quality text-to-speech technology by <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.acapela-group.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Acapela</a> to enhance immersion<br></li><li>No grinding, no killing, no looting – just 100% pure role-playing</li></ul>",
