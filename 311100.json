In the realism of the implementation of the gaming environment – the cockpit of the battle hovercraft – Echelon is comparable with the best flight simulators.

Worthy of a look if you own a joystick or have played this type of game with your trusty mouse.”<br>70 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.incgamers.com/2008/04/echelon-wind-warriors-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >IncGamers</a><br>",
