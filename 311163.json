Offering major savings on weapons and items, this bundle will ensure you're armed to the teeth and ready for anything when battle commences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor starters, the Engineer Pack places a rare A3-210 weapon into your hands. This stylized piece of kit not only looks the part, it also offers a level of firepower that you can rely on when the battle really heats up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf looks could kill, the Engineer soldier skin that comes with the pack would be held responsible for an astronomical body count. Boasting unique head gear, enemies won't even have the privilege of seeing your face before you dispatch them. Now that's cold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther adding to your arsenal, the pack also features 7 days worth of smoke grenades. Simply remove the pin, throw in the desired direction and your enemies will not know from which angle you're coming.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, even with so much firepower in your favor, there's always the chance you could be the one on the wrong end of a stray bullet. Ensuring you're prepared for such an eventuality, the Engineer Pack features 10 Resurrection Coins for the Co-op mode to bring you back from the brink multiple times and give you a freakish air of invincibility. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the Engineer Pack also provides 7 full days of stat boosts to ensure your bravery in battle is well and truly rewarded. With the booster in play, expect 100% more rewards on XP earned, 75% more Warface Dollars than you'd usually earn for your antics, and 50% % faster item unlocks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Warface Engineer Starter Pack is granted only once per account and only on the first server visited after the purchase.",
