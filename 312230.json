            "reviews": "“Spirits of Xanadu offers an enriching gameplay experience that lingers on the edge of my thoughts even now. While I feared it would turn out to be just another sci-fi horror adventure, it jumped up and surprised me with meaningful storytelling, interesting mysteries, and three different endings (all of which are extremely impactful, depending on what kind of psychotic person you are).”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gizorama.com/2015/computer/pc/ghost-ship-head-trip-spirits-of-xanadu-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Johnny Ohm, Gizorama</a><br><br>“The game is proof that you don't need Unreal Engine 4 visuals or graphic violence to be scary and immersive, all you need is a character, a ship and the endless void where all your dreams - and all your nightmares - can exist.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamenguide.com/articles/22503/20150324/spirits-of-xanadu-review-in-space-no-one-can-hear-you-go-insane-in-this-solid-successor-to-system-shock.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Steve Buja, Gamenguide</a><br><br>“This is an impressive little horror game because of how heavily it avoids typical horror imagery. Sure, there’s a blood trail marking the path of a [dragged] body, but that’s the only bit of gore in the whole game. Instead, Spirits of Xanadu leans into the surreal and the mystical, like floating kabuki masks and lotus flowers casually placed in a briefcase, all taking place in an alternative futuristic 1983.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/culture-is-alien-in-spirits-of-xanadu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Nick Dinicola, PopMatters</a><br>",
