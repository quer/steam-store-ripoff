You signed up in hopes of a new life, a chance to be part of humanities first extra solar colonization mission. Things were cut short however, when, after a couple of years into the mission, a distress signal was received from Earth. They were under attack by an unknown alien force, and then all went silent. Now, having had to cancel its mission, the Ensign-1 turns around, possibly as Earth's last defense against this new threat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay the role of Leon Deckard, one of Ensign-1's finest in it's space forces. Through a series of missions, it will be up to you to take back our solar system from the enemy, and you won't need to stay in your fighter to do it. You'll have the freedom to board other ships and stations, plant bombs, and man turrets. Ensign-1 is a tough as nails space combat game built around the idea of being able to leave your space fighter. You'll need to think creatively to make it back alive.",
