It is a 2D top-down puzzle adventure that focuses on pure gameplay mechanics, best described succinctly as &quot;chess in a Zelda-like environment.&quot;  The DROD series began over a decade ago and has enthralled thousands of players.<br><br>Swordplay and puzzles combine in this thinking man's dungeon crawl.  It's simple to learn, with just a handful of commands to master.  This game's rogue-like exterior belies clever puzzle design and unique play mechanics that provide amazing depth.  Each room is a hand-crafted puzzle that you solve by clearing out all the monsters with your Really Big Sword without letting any reach and kill you. Monster types each have their own AI, with deterministic movement patterns. Puzzle elements and terrain types help and hinder you in solving each puzzle. You start by learning basic mechanics and fighting techniques, and then the difficulty steadily ramps up as each room you face presents a fresh challenge with a logical solution. This game features a novel play style, with story- and puzzle-driven voiced dialogue delivered inline with hardcore puzzle solving that involves a mix of strategy, tactics, lateral thinking and linchpins.
