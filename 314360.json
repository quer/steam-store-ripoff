Tabata, the Chieftain, is terribly sick and Raoni, the Wiseman, is taking care of him. A powerful Forest Spirit took over Tabata’s body and only an ancient ritual can undo the spell. Unfortunately, the most important ingredient is missing: a feather of a rare harpy named Uiruuetê. Aritana, against Raoni's decision, embarks in this dangerous mission. The sacred feather can only be found at the top of the highest mountain, through the lands of the man-eater Mapinguari. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/314360/extras/agl01.png?t=1520812405\" ><br><br>Aritana is a platform game which the main aspect of its mechanics is the possibility of changing your stance.

Meanwhile, Mapinguari will chase him constantly, forcing battles that require concentration and mastery of all skills learned. <br><br>With the help of the Shaman's Staff and the benefits of each stance, Aritana will be able to search for the Lost Artifacts and gain access to the Spirit World.
