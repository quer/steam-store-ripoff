These tighten up Abe's movement and make lateral hops much easier to pull off.<br><br>Once on, Abe will no longer run without the player pressing the 'run' button, and will hop to the side rather than straight up, making mines easier to leap over and distances easier to judge.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/314660/extras/steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_386809083_preview.jpg?t=1548161092\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Re-mapping the controls:</h2><br>New 'n' Tasty supports in-game remapping for controllers and keyboards.<br><br>To remap a controller, ensure the &quot;Input Method&quot; is set to Controller, and then go to &quot;Button Layout&quot; and select &quot;Xbox 360&quot; at the top to bring up a dropdown. From the dropdown, select &quot;Custom&quot; and then remap as needed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Supported controllers:</h2><br>Windows: Xbox 360; Xbox One; DualShock 4, Steam Controller; Logitech F310, F510, F710; XInput compatible.
