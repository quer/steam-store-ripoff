(Jul 2018)<br><br>The latest massive update for Trainz: A New Era delivers better stability, smoother performance and improved compatibility, along with plenty of bug fixes and enhancements across the board. <br><br>With over 3 years of free updates since the official release in 2015, with each major update we've been working hard to ensure that all players can experience the best Trainz has to offer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Platinum Edition Bundle</strong></u></h2>In conjunction with the latest update, we've also released a &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; bundle to provide fantastic value for new or existing customers. New customers can get almost double the content that was included in the original Standard Edition, at 75% off the regular pricing.<br><br>Existing customers can also expand their collection with 75% off the items they don't already own. In addition, we've retired the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; with it's four extra routes and replaced it with the mcu-better-value Platinum Edition.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>What makes Trainz so special?</strong></u></h2><br>Trainz: A New Era is far more than a train simulator. Sure there are hundreds of locos and dozens of routes and sessions you can drive in the Platinum Edition Bundle. But the real power of Trainz comes with all the extra things you can do beyond the builtin-in content set.<br><br>All the tools to build your own railroad are included, and in fact, every route you see in Trainz is created by customers just like you. There are now well over 10,000 routes available on the Trainz Download Station (DLS) that you can download for free and enjoy. So when people tell you &quot;you have to buy lots of DLC&quot; remind them that the choice is theirs, with plenty of high quality free routes and content available on the DLS.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Key Features</strong></u></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">All-new graphics engine with full world shadows and per-pixel lighting</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/graphics_engineC.png?t=1531292768\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2> <br>Share your enthusiasm with other rail fans and combine your efforts with others to operate a working rail line!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Our most accurate simulation yet with real time world physics and editing tools!</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/PhysicsC.png?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>Our physics use a variety of configurable inputs such as engine powers, train weight and rolling resistance whilst taking into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each train car when accelerating or decelerating. The brand new real time physics editing tools allow players to tune physics 'on-the-fly' to take their simulation's performance even further.<br><br>Brand-new Real-time Physics Editing tools enable users to enter known specifications to accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).<br><br>If physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite locomotive's performance to the experts whilst still having the choice between 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedurally animated spline junctions</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/SPlinesC.png?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>An updated set of track laying tools are provided in Surveyor to automatically adds frogs/vee, blades, and checkrails in the correct place on the tracks when making a switch, turnout or junction. The blades then animate as the junction direction is changed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Realistic cab sway and external train motion</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/Train_MotionC.png?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>Using a new suspension modelling system and additional track and traincar parameters, cab sway and &quot;car rocking&quot; from both internal and external perspective provide more realistic train motion visuals. When running on rough track, cars will wobble and shake independently.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Smoke and weather affected by world objects</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/Environmental_EffectsC.png?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>New particle effects and collision systems will prevent rain penetrating a tunnel, smoke will billow out from the underside of a bridge or the top of a tunnel and all particle effects will change velocity, direction and flow more naturally.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Tons of Extra Content</strong></u></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Access to over 250,000+ free DLC items via The Download Station</li><li>In-game downloadable content system for both payware and freeware options</li><li>Create your own routes with powerful in-game level editing tools</li><li>Configurable control schemes</li><li>Never lose your way with the in-game navigation system</li><li>Open multiple windows to view and compare items in Preview Mode while creating your world in another window</li><li>Incl. 250 page digital user manual - a digital PDF providing detailed information on every aspect of Trainz</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Standard Edition Routes and Sessions</strong></u></h2><br>Trainz: A New Era provides a variety of high quality routes - built-in to the core edition, available as Downloadable Content (payware) or from the DLS (freeware). <br><br><strong>Kickstarter County</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/Kickstarter-new.jpg?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>Based upon the famous Highland Valley route from the early days of Trainz, Kickstarter County has received a huge upgrade with new content, new track, new industries, and new high definition assets.<br><br><strong>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio RR, Hinton Division - (United States, 1950)</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/Hinton-new.jpg?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>Hinton Division, one of the major coal producing areas for the C&amp;O, starts just west of Thurmond, WV through to Hinton, WV and includes 4 subdivisions.

But the real power of Trainz comes with all the extra things you can do beyond the builtin-in content set.<br><br>All the tools to build your own railroad are included, and in fact, every route you see in Trainz is created by customers just like you. There are now well over 10,000 routes available on the Trainz Download Station (DLS) that you can download for free and enjoy. So when people tell you &quot;you have to buy lots of DLC&quot; remind them that the choice is theirs, with plenty of high quality free routes and content available on the DLS.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Key Features</strong></u></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">All-new graphics engine with full world shadows and per-pixel lighting</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/graphics_engineC.png?t=1531292768\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2> <br>Share your enthusiasm with other rail fans and combine your efforts with others to operate a working rail line!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Our most accurate simulation yet with real time world physics and editing tools!</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/PhysicsC.png?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>Our physics use a variety of configurable inputs such as engine powers, train weight and rolling resistance whilst taking into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each train car when accelerating or decelerating. The brand new real time physics editing tools allow players to tune physics 'on-the-fly' to take their simulation's performance even further.<br><br>Brand-new Real-time Physics Editing tools enable users to enter known specifications to accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car).<br><br>If physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite locomotive's performance to the experts whilst still having the choice between 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedurally animated spline junctions</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/SPlinesC.png?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>An updated set of track laying tools are provided in Surveyor to automatically adds frogs/vee, blades, and checkrails in the correct place on the tracks when making a switch, turnout or junction.

When running on rough track, cars will wobble and shake independently.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Smoke and weather affected by world objects</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/Environmental_EffectsC.png?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>New particle effects and collision systems will prevent rain penetrating a tunnel, smoke will billow out from the underside of a bridge or the top of a tunnel and all particle effects will change velocity, direction and flow more naturally.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Tons of Extra Content</strong></u></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Access to over 250,000+ free DLC items via The Download Station</li><li>In-game downloadable content system for both payware and freeware options</li><li>Create your own routes with powerful in-game level editing tools</li><li>Configurable control schemes</li><li>Never lose your way with the in-game navigation system</li><li>Open multiple windows to view and compare items in Preview Mode while creating your world in another window</li><li>Incl. 250 page digital user manual - a digital PDF providing detailed information on every aspect of Trainz</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><u><strong>Standard Edition Routes and Sessions</strong></u></h2><br>Trainz: A New Era provides a variety of high quality routes - built-in to the core edition, available as Downloadable Content (payware) or from the DLS (freeware). <br><br><strong>Kickstarter County</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/Kickstarter-new.jpg?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>Based upon the famous Highland Valley route from the early days of Trainz, Kickstarter County has received a huge upgrade with new content, new track, new industries, and new high definition assets.<br><br><strong>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio RR, Hinton Division - (United States, 1950)</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/315660/extras/Hinton-new.jpg?t=1531292768\" ><br><br>Hinton Division, one of the major coal producing areas for the C&amp;O, starts just west of Thurmond, WV through to Hinton, WV and includes 4 subdivisions.
