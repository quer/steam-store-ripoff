I would wager that it is one of the most well crafted Indie JRPG’s that I’ve played in recent years.”<br>99/100 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.modvive.com/2015/08/10/celestian-tales-old-north-refreshing-the-indie-jrpg-scene/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >ModVive</a><br><br>“Ekuator Games have gone above and beyond to bring an interesting, dramatic, and most importantly believable story to the table... Perhaps some of the bigger names in the genre should take a page from indie Ekuator Games’ book and focus on making believable characters and intriguing storylines, and worry less about the ancient prophecies and all-powerful weapons.”<br>Yay! – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.popzara.com/games/game-reviews/celestian-tales-old-north/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PopZara</a><br>",
