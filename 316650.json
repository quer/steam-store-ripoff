Castles &amp; Crusades has touched upon them from time to time, but by and large they have remained in the background. Until now.<br><br>Kim Hartsfield, long-time veteran of classic gaming, brings many of these monsters back to life. Anyone who games with Kim knows he runs a hard-knock game of classic dimensions and epic adventures. Kim revisits the old monster books, MM II and the Fiend Folio, mining their pages for all those classic monsters that mystified and horrified young gamers of every description.
