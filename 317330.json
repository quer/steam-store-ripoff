This is a Tower Defense but its not your dad's tower defense... well it kind of is but I'll explain that in a moment. The first thing you need to know is that Defenders of time is fast so rule #1 is don't stop spending. Don't ever stop spending. Don't worry if you made a mistake you can always resell your towers and get all of your money back. Yeah every cent. Yes that's 100% resell. Yes its a Tower Defense. No that doesn't make the DoT easy. Hold on; stop asking me questions let me explain. <br><br>The Defenders of Time demo gives you unlimited access to try Single Player for free! The best part of our demo is anyone that purchased Defenders of Time can invite you to their games and you can check out multiplayer!
