From that time, I planned to make and place these cool iron boxes into my favorite simulator, making our experiences more awesome and more realistic. <br><br>Now, you will get a total of 10 styles of 20ft and 40ft dry van containers in your railroad world. You are able to carry them by X2K double-stack container well wagons.<br><br>Features Include:<br>- 10 styles.<br>- Normal Maps.<br>- Weathered. <br><br><strong>X2K DOUBLE-STACK CONTAINER WELL WAGONS</strong><br>If you intend to travel between Shanghai and Beijing by train, maybe you'll pass a train with double-stacked containers - chances are it will be these, as the X2 series well wagons are the only double-stack container wagons in China. <br><br>The X2 series double-stack container well wagon is specially designed to carry container traffic. Once a X2 wagon equips ZK6 bogies, it’s called “X2K”, and its max speed is up to 120 km/h. <br><br>Three colors of X2K wagons are included, which should be mixed in a long train for a more realistic effect!<br><br>Features Include:<br>- Normal Maps.<br>- Weathered.<br>- Rear Sign Light.<br>- Load Product.<br>- LOD System.<br><br><strong>CONTAINER YARD</strong><br>Need a place to show off your containers? Here it is. This original container yard references the Luchaogang container yard. It's a new yard<br><br>in Shanghai, used to storage containers which were carried from Yangshan Deep Water Port and transit by trains. Though its length has been reduced to 500 meters, and it can stack a maximum over 1,000 containers.<br><br>Features Include:<br>- Normal Maps.<br>- Weathered.<br>- Animate objects.<br>- Can stack over 1,000 Containers.",
