Together with him you set out to explore said woods and the village, picking up whatever you find useful along the way. Once you meet the villagers, the fun can truly begin! You'll have numerous ways of messing things up, from manipulating villagers to kill each other to using Kel's special skill of cursing to damage their brain.<br />\r\nOr, of course, you could play nice and please everyone in the village, though Kel might object to that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are all sorts of unexpected little secrets to discover, 15 amusing achievements to complete and enough twisted humor to go round.",
