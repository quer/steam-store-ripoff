The Reboot Edition offers a full gameplay overhaul: new resource system, playable builder units, new base buildings, simplified research system, and many major mechanic improvements for smoother and more dynamic gameplay in skirmish mode against the AI and in your multiplayer battles.

Embark on an epic single player <strong>Campaign</strong> with a thrilling original story, and <strong>fight </strong>throughout the world on realistic environments. <strong>Compete online</strong> in visceral PVP battles and become the best commander! <br><br><strong>Act of Aggression Reboot Edition brings new features to skirmish modes:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Streamlined Economy</strong>: Manage two resources: oil and cash, allowing you to focus on the action.

Build directly from the builder (or destroy your opponent’s builder!) <br></li><li><strong>New Airstrikes</strong>: You no longer control the planes mid-flight. They go directly to their target and strike, much faster than previously. <br></li><li><strong>Huge balancing update and unit model improvements as well as UI tweaks and changes</strong>: for example, all units now accelerate and decelerate faster, with more streamlined, action packed RTS gameplay. </li></ul>",
