            "reviews": "“This is an entry in the series that long-time fans will love… the game delivers strong in so many ways that you will look over any of the weak puzzles and enjoy another outing with Nancy, the Hardys, and the usual collection of goofy and humorous characters (even a recurring character from a previous mystery!), accompanied by dialogue that’s more crisp and witty than it has been in a while.”<br>Just Adventure<br><br>“The game offers hours of thrilling detective work. As all the Nancy Drew games, Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon is targeted to mystery fans ages 10 to adult. It is worth noting that this is the kind of game that can be particularly enjoyable to play with other people. You can have a wonderful time discovering the mystery with a friend or family member. Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon can be easily recommended to adventure and mystery fans.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventurelantern.com/Reviews/NDLastTrainToBlueMoonCanyon/NDLastTrainToBlueMoonCanyon.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Adventure Lantern</a><br><br>“These puzzles are varied, logical, and make sense in the train’s historical context, and there is something simply enjoyable about investigating the different characters and piecing together clues to the mystery of both Lori Girard’s disappearance and Jake’s old mine. Although more could have been made to involve them in the investigation, the introduction of the Hardy Boys is also a nice reward for longtime Nancy Drew fans.”<br>Adventure Gamers<br>",
