The graphics, characters, game play, innovations and ambiance all added up to a captivating time with my favorite girl sleuth.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gameboomers.com/reviews/Nn/NDHauntedbygatorlaw.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Boomers</a><br><br>“Parents of teens know how hard it is to find games for their kids which don’t have graphic violence and sexual content. Her Interactive has done an excellent job with this series in providing challenging adventures which are fun and engaging, and which are culturally relevant to today’s teen, without resorting to the programming laziness of cheap sex and extreme violence. The Haunted Carousel is a great game to get for kids ages 12-16 (and older and younger, too).”<br>PC GameZone<br>",
