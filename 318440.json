Come and lead your people through a challenging journey: charming and yet unknown world awaits you!<br><br>Cubesis is a turn-based strategy game with puzzle elements, centered around the fragile balance of the Cubeworld. You have to solve strategy-like puzzles and the way to their solution is beset by many obstacles: for example the sea. To overcome such obstacles, you need to figure out what pleases the gods Ikjuch and Likael.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Fragile balance</strong><br>Balance constitute the core mechanic of the game.
