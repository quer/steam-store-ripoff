The story is exciting and offers a little spookiness in the beginning; in fact, some younger players may be scared at first, which parents should be aware of. Whether your kids are Nancy Drew fans or not, this game will interest most teens and many adults, as well.”<br>PC GameZone<br><br>“Ghost Dogs isn’t a bad little game and deserves the FFC thumb up! It’s the perfect game for a beginner just starting out or an experienced adventurer looking for a mystery that isn’t too tough on those “little grey cells.””<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Nancy_Drew_7/Ghost_Dogs.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >FourFatChicks</a><br><br>“I would recommend any and all of the titles in this series to adventure gamers everywhere. Of the lot, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is one of the best. I am pleased that Her Interactive acquired the rights to produce these games, and that there are more to come. I think that if you want the gaming equivalent of slipping into your favorite PJs and coziest chair for an engaging and fun mental diversion, you can’t go wrong with Nancy Drew in general, and Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake in particular. So with that in mind, this reviewer highly recommends Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.mrbillsadventureland.com/reviews/m-n/nancydrewR/nancydrew7R.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Mr. Bill’s Adventureland</a><br>",
