While this is an impressive accomplishment for any series, that’s not Clock’s only distinction. The game is based on the first book in the Nancy Drew canon, the game’s release date is the 75th anniversary of that book’s publication, and the game is done in period, right down to Nancy’s more-or-less Model A roadster. Clock carries all this baggage effortlessly, providing players with one of the most sprightly entries in the series.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Nancy_Drew_12/Clock.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >FourFatChicks</a><br><br>“Like a cake, Her Interactive has all the ingredients – dialogue, voice work, and story – to cook up a confection that will be enjoyed by both Junior and Senior detectives. They even add a few new things such as an in-game map and a roadster (cool!) to get around in.”<br>Adventure Gamers<br>",
