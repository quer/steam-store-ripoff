As I have said time and time again, do not be confused into thinking this and other Nancy Drew games are only good for children and young teens. They are quality entertainment for anyone who enjoys adventuring and puzzle solving. This latest installment is among the best of the bunch, and anyone who has been missing out on this great series must consider picking it up.” - <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/392/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Adventure Classic Gaming</a>",
