It’s a solid game effort by Her Interactive and those who might have been passing on the Nancy Drew series might just want to give this one a try. In my opinion, The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is an excellent step in the right direction.”<br />\r\nJust Adventure<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Suitable for all ages, the game also contains some educational tidbits on wildlife and brain-teasing puzzles that may make it a good choice for children and families, though prospective buyers may want to note that there are some characters that fall into possibly offensive racial stereotypes. In any case, though, it’s a decent adventure game, and fans of the series will probably find it worthwhile to take a look.”<br />\r\nGame Chronicles<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“At the end of the day, Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is everything we have come to expect from this series of games. It has nicely enmeshed puzzles peppered throughout the game, a number of quirky characters to interact with and a solidly written dialogue.”<br />\r\nAdventure Gamers<br />\r\n",
