Worlds that fell victim to his rage were swallowed by lava or entombed in ice, leaving none alive. Supposed to wield both fists of undying flame and the cold of an eternal winter, Jotunn Skølldir truly is one of the last remaining legends of the galaxy. Those who have witnessed the destruction left behind by him are never the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Skølldir in Awesomenauts. You need to have Skølldir available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game. The skin-design and sound effects vary depending on whether the player is currently playing for the Red or the Blue team, with Jotunn Skølldir assuming his fire-form in the Red team, and an ice-form in the Blue team. The Jotunn Skølldir skin does NOT have a unique voice over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJotunn Skølldir was designed by community member CrimsonYeti for the Design-a-skin competition and was chosen by the community as one the runner-ups to Grim Genji from more than 250 submissions!",
