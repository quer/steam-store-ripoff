With brilliant resolution, night lighting and water effects, this scenery really is as real as it gets!<br><br>VFR stands for Visual Flight Rules – this is how pilots navigate when they aren’t using complex instruments. They look at a map and then pinpoint landmarks on the ground to work out their course and position. It’s the most common form of recreational flying undertaken in the UK, but to do this in a flight simulator requires scenery that is exactly the same as the real landscape. VFR Real Scenery is an amazing piece of software that does just that.<br><br>Fly over England and Wales in Flight Simulator X using VFR Real Scenery and you will see the same view you'd get from a real aircraft.

They're all featured – streets, buildings, rivers, lakes, reservoirs – and all at extremely high resolution and detail.<br><br>As well as accurate scenery, the VFR Real Scenery series includes night lighting effects customised for extra realism and superb 9.6m mesh which hugely improves the accuracy of the relief – the ups and downs of the terrain have never been so precise!
