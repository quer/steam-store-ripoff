They look at a map and then pinpoint landmarks on the ground to work out their course and position. It’s the most common form of recreational flying undertaken in the UK, but to do this in a flight simulator requires scenery that is exactly the same as the real landscape. VFR Real Scenery is an amazing piece of software that does just that.<br><br>Fly over England and Wales in Flight Simulator X using VFR Real Scenery and you will see the same view you'd get from a real aircraft.
