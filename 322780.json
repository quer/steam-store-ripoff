Want faster engines but less powerful cannons? Done!<br><br><strong>Ship Painting</strong> - Further customise your beloved vessel by individually painting its various parts and components.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/322780/extras/HAVEN-Video.jpg?t=1549454213\" ><br><br>Another suggestion to surface from Early Access, Haven is a tutorial starting zone to better prepare travellers for the world of Foundation.<br><br><strong>Cooking </strong>- Travellers can now cook a range long-lost recipes. From Manta Curry to Marauder Rum (great together!), unlock a range of nutritional buffs.<br><br><strong>Epheremus Drifter</strong> - Jump from ship to ship, island to island, with the Epheremus Drifter; an atlas-fuelled jetpack!<br><br><br>Suffice to say, <i>New Foundations</i> only marks the beginning of what’s to come for Worlds Adrift. As always, we’re enormously grateful for your ongoing support, and greatly anticipate what we’ll continue to achieve together come next year… and beyond!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The world is in pieces, shattered from a calamity that time has since forgotten. It now falls to you to journey across its perilous skies, foraging the remains of past civilisations. Rally a crew. Build a skyship. Conspire with others to overthrow those that would oppose you, and ultimately find fame… <i>or </i>infamy. The future of Foundation will be shaped by YOUR actions - will you help unite the world, or let it drift further into chaos? <br><br>Worlds Adrift is a truly ambitious undertaking that's redefining the genre through its use of crowdsourced content. Not only the world's <i>first </i>Community-Crafted MMO, having been designed for and ultimately shaped by its passionate fanbase, it also marks a technical breakthrough as the first game to employ the exciting possibilities of SpatialOS; a platform allowing for the physical simulation of skyships with unprecedented customization options. Offering an entirely user-generated environment, the sheer scale of its scope, and beauty of its design, is an invitation to explore. To discover. <i>To</i> <i>unearth</i>…<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/322780/extras/Explore_Videogif.jpg?t=1549454213\" ><br><br>Countless islands populate a seemingly endless sky.
