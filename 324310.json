Transport your passengers to their destinations across five authentic city districts safely and on time. Drive a two-door, three-door, or a true-to-life articulated bus through commuter traffic at rush hour, watch out for emergency vehicles, and take detours around construction sites. Make sure that you are always aware of your surroundings or you will get into trouble for accidents and traffic violations!<br><br>Apart from driving you will also have to maintain order on the inside of your bus. Calm upset passengers, repair stuck doors, sell the correct tickets, and extend the ramp for wheelchair users in a timely manner. You will have to be efficient if you want to stick to your schedule and increase your reputation in the city, earn the trust of your passengers and most importantly make lots of money! The better your reputation, the larger the contracts you will be able to secure, and the more buses will be available to your company in the shop. Unlock additional districts of the city and carefully plan routes for bus drivers in your employ, who you can hire through the ingame job exchange.<br><br>As you grow more and more successful, you will also be able to acquire advertising banners for your buses, which will bring in some additional funds. If you are not satisfied with the appearance of your buses, you can paint and decorate them with unlockable decals, ensuring that your passengers will reach their destinations in the coolest way possible. <br><br><strong>Multiplayer Mode</strong><br><br>You think bus drivers are lonely?
