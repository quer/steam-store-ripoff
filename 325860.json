            "short_description": "Fat Chicken is a REVERSE TOWER DEFENSE game where you fatten up farm animals for slaughter by pumping them full of hormones, overfeeding them and basting them with antibiotics to keep them alive so they're worth more when you turn 'em into tasty, tasty packaged meat...it's what's for dinner!",

            "reviews": "“Whether it raises awareness on food preparation or even changes your opinions, Fat Chicken remains a solid tower defense title. The change in purpose and limited tower placement forces you to be more strategic, especially if you're aiming for a three-star rating. The difficulty is just right, and so is the length, which is long enough to give the game value without overstaying its welcome. Fat Chicken is definitely a game worth checking out, even if you're a casual fan of the genre.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2015/1/12/reviews/94586/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >WorthPlaying</a><br><br>“More than just another tower defense title, the unique features and creative take on the genre have built a solid, highly-addictive game with simple, intuitive in-game controls that keep the action moving.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.twinfinite.net/2014/11/03/bring-home-bacon-fat-chicken-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >TWINFINITE</a><br><br>“Fat Chicken is very fun yet challenging.
