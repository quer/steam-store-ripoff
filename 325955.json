Whilst EMD’s SD40-2 was more reliable, GE’s line included locomotives up to 3,600hp (2,685kW) with more modern technology.<br><br>EMD’s had already established a track record for producing 3,600hp locomotives, with the SD45 and SD45-2; however, demand for these gas guzzlers dropped sharply after the 1970s fuel crises. The SD50 was heavily updated, with a new V16 engine uprated with more horsepower. Unfortunately, this proved to be an unsuccessful move as the 50 series models were plagued by engine and electrical system problems.<br><br>The SD50’s long hood saw changes from previous EMD models; the overall frame length was increased, and the long hood was made substantially longer. Resistors for the dynamic brake grid were also moved to a new, cooler location in front of the engine compartment air intakes, thereby simplifying the prime mover maintenance procedures, and the electrical system as well.<br><br>The EMD SD50 for Train Simulator, developed by Digital Train Model, is available in Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad livery and features engine start/stop, dynamic brakes, front and rear headlights, numberboard lights, class lights and step lights.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the D&amp;RGW SD50 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
