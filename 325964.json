            "detailed_description": "The Norfolk Southern Big 7s add-on brings two variations of the GE Dash 7 locomotive to Train Simulator. <br><br>The 3,600 horsepower four-axle GE B36-7 was built from 1980 until 1985 as successor to the famous U36B ‘U-Boats’. Of the 230 locomotives produced, Seaboard System Railroad (which became part of CSX Transportation in 1986) and Conrail purchased the majority between them. CSX became the last Class 1 railroad to include B36-7s in operational rosters. <br><br>The six-axle GE C36-7 predates the four-axle variant, having first been produced in 1978. Unlike the B36-7, however, the majority were exported to overseas markets. <br><br>The Norfolk Southern Big 7s for Train Simulator, developed by DigitalTrainModel, includes both the GE B36-7 High Nose and Low Nose variants, plus GE C36-7 ph1 AD, ph1 GSC and ph2 GSC variants in Norfolk Southern livery, and non-driver models as ‘dead’ rolling stock. Other features include class lights, step lights and number board lights, speed recorder, ditch lights and animated front and rear mirrors.<br><br>The locomotives are also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Norfolk Southern Big 7s on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/258654\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Norfolk Southern Coal District</a> route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Five scenarios for the Norfolk Southern Coal District route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tAt the NS’ Beat: Part 1<br></li><li>\tAt the NS’ Beat: Part 2<br></li><li>\tSignal to Signal<br></li><li>\tThe Horse Power<br></li><li>\tTypical Work</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
