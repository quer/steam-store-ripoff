Following this rebuilding process, which was performed by Conrail at its famed Juniata (Altoona, Pennsylvania) shops, the NJ TRANSIT locomotives were classified as F40PH-2CATs and went on to provide another decade-and-a-half of capable duty on NJ TRANSIT’s sprawling commuter rail system.  <br><br>Throughout their long careers, the stylish F40PH-2CATs were regularly employed on NJ TRANSIT’s North Jersey Coast Line, operating to and from Hoboken Terminal, as well as powering the “shuttles” between Long Branch and Bay Head, New Jersey. Thus, the veteran F40PH-2CAT is an ideal and highly authentic locomotive for service on Train Simulator’s NJCL route.
