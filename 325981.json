From Bullay, trains cross the well-known dual deck bridge and then the railway viaduct near Pünderich. It is here where the route branches off towards Traben-Trarbach, while the main route leaves the Mosel Valley and proceeds to Trier through to Wittlich.<br><br>Just a short distance from Trier, the route meets the Mosel River for the penultimate time, before passing Ehrang with its large depot and goods station, Pfalzel and finally Trier, where a large industrial area and harbour dominate the landscape.<br><br>The route today is heavily used by freight traffic crossing Germany onto their final destinations across Europe.
