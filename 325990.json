The line itself sees a 457m altitude difference in its 41km in length, and 60% of the track is on a 2-2.5% (around 1:40) gradient, with as much as 16% featuring very tight radius curves at only 190m.<br><br>From Gloggnitz in the east, the line passes through a number of small hamlets high in the mountainous Alps to Payerbach-Reichenau, where local passenger services from Vienna terminate. It is here that one of the Alps’ major ski resorts is located, as well as a heritage railway running in the mountains. Heading southwards, the line crosses the stunning Schwarza Viaduct before Küb and Klamm-Schottwein, where the landscape is most famous for the expansive S6 motorway viaduct.<br><br>Between Klamm-Schottwein and Breitenstein, trains pass through probably the most famous part of the route, The Viaduct – a spectacular open-sided tunnel that provides a photographer’s dream setting. From Semmering (the highest point on the route), the line heads downhill towards Mürzzuschlag, where large freight yards and a locomotive maintenance and servicing yard dominate.<br><br>At the time of opening, the incredible grades and tight curves resulted in the need for new locomotives that could more easily handle the task. Thus, a competition was held to find traction that was able to traverse the grades and curves while maintaining a minimum speed of 11.5km/h (7mph).<br><br>Eventually, the railway settled for the Engerth locomotive, a unique articulated tender locomotive that had a top speed of 19km/h (11mph) up the steepest gradients thanks to the weight of the fuel and water being spread across all the axles, providing more traction.<br><br>The increased accessibility to the mountains thanks to the railway saw a number of purpose-built Alpine resorts, with parts of the railway becoming known for their summer orientated architecture such as hotels and villas. It also lead to the construction of residential areas, creating a new form of landscape not usually seen on mountainous terrain. <br><br>Today, the line is owned and operated by the Austrian Federal Railways some 160 years after its construction and plays a key role in connecting Vienna and Graz as part of the ÖBB Southern Railway. It was also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1998.<br><br>However, despite the fantastic scenery, towering bridges, challenging grades and rich history, a new 27.3km (16 mile) tunnel is being constructed under the mountains to bypass the Semmeringbahn, and is expected to open in 2024.<br><br>Included with this primarily freight route is a Class 1116 in ÖBB Livery, Habbins bogie van wagons, Zags bogie tanker wagons, SGGRSS container wagons, TDRRS two-axle hopper wagons and Bmz Eurofima coaches.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2><br>Seven scenarios for the route:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tThe Sound of Mountains<br></li><li>\tMorning Haul<br></li><li>\tHigh up the Hill<br></li><li>\tThe Lonely Driver<br></li><li>\tClimb Every Mountain<br></li><li>\tMy Favourite Things<br></li><li>\tI Have Confidence</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
