In the 1950s, the NYNH&amp;H’s Springfield-Hartford-New Haven corridor was a busy center of New England manufacturing, and the line offers countless opportunities for serving those industries with local and switching operations. Plus, the route’s many beautiful lineside stations (including large stations at Springfield, Hartford, and New Haven) provide for classic-era passenger railroading at its best. <br><br>In addition to re-creating New Haven’s Springfield main line, the route includes a variety of adjoining branch lines and spurs, such as New Haven’s branch to Suffield and Windsor Locks, its Bloomfield/Griffin branch, the quarry line at Meriden, extensive industrial trackage around Hartford, and New Haven’s Mill River branch. Major freight yard and terminal facilities exist at Springfield, Hartford, and New Haven, keynoted by New Haven’s famously massive, 880-acre Cedar Hill Yard, which was the largest terminal complex in New England.<br><br>The Virtual New Haven Railroad Springfield Line features a trio of locomotives from America’s three dominant diesel builders – the versatile GP9 from Electro-Motive; Alco’s 1,000-horsepower S-2 switcher; and General Electric’s diminutive 44-tonner.
