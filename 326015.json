These 125 wagons to lot 3764 were coded as COV CD and painted Freight Brown with a large Double Arrow high on the left hand side. In the 2nd half of 1974, Shildon Works constructed a further 100 vans to lot 3832. It is these 2 lots of wagons that feature in this pack.<br><br>After the changeover to TOPS, these vans were coded as VCA, though the 2nd lot were incorrectly labelled as VBA when new (not featured in the pack). In time, the first lot were repainted in Maroon livery with a boxed Double Arrow and Railfreight branding. Both lots later received Railfreight Flame Red &amp; Grey livery.<br><br>The VCAs seem to have been mainly used for tinplate traffic from South Wales to various Metal Box Company factories around the country and for export traffic.
