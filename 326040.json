Using either horsepower or steam power, canal barges plied between the major manufacturing centres of Britain with deliveries of fuel and products, using a network of level canal ways with systems of locks to allow gradients to be negotiated. Many of those old canals can still be seen today, and a number of the former canal barges have been converted into brightly-painted narrow boats for holiday use and even as accommodation. <br />\r\nThe Canal Pack for Train Simulator includes a number of assets to enable you to create realistic canal scenes within Train Simulator routes. Included are a canal lock, typical canal stone bridge, canal tunnel entrance, canal-side buildings, picnic tables, four designs of narrow boat, and canal lofts with and without animated canal boat traffic.",
