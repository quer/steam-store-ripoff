The game offers plenty of places and possibilities to prove your fighting skills, but the most intense battles take place on Irselnort. Capturing enemy camps, defending your own ones and harsh clashes between hundreds of players - what can be better? Only massive battles between Guilds for the right to have your own Castle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique system of crafting and improving items</h2><br>Apart from boss killing, Dungeon examining and trading, there is one more way of getting weapons and gear in the game.
