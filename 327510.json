From the ashes of old America, a new world emerges, and an ersatz, post-apocalyptic, stillborn 80’s continues indefinitely, populated entirely by the toughest, meanest, and outright dumbest of God’s creations, the Wasters.<br><br>Live the life of a Waster, fighting tooth and nail, bullets and baseball bats over the most precious of unnatural resources, a liquid from beneath the sands that fuels all of un-civilization: Booze. Gain strange mutational Hangovers and explore the Coolers, mysterious underground bunkers, in search of powerful weapons, impressive armor, and a nice stiff drink to top it all off. Who knows, maybe you'll uncover some old world secrets while you're at it.<br><br>Or don't, because death comes quick in the Western Wastes, and what's yours today just might be picked off your pile of guts tomorrow.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><br><strong>Get Wasted...</strong><br>Customize your character through the S.H.O.T.S. system by drinking irradiated bottles of Booze.

Scrounge up ammo and items from your surroundings and loot the bodies of dead enemies for their stuff. Just take care not to overextend yourself - when your character dies, they're gone for good.<br><br><strong>Carve Out Your Own Little Slice Of The Wastes</strong><br>Build up your persistent player home and keep it stocked with weapons and supplies to keep you alive and ticking. Carve out your own little slice of the wastes by fitting your house with amenities like workbenches, kitchens, and gardens and decorate it with junk you find through your travels.
