When Alan disappears mysteriously, finding him is up to Jet, his son. Jet uses his father's technology to enter the computer world and, while investigating his father's disappearance, discovers a sinister plot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFour &quot;primitive&quot; weapons -- disk, rod, ball, and mesh -- are encountered in the computer world, though the disk is the only weapon that can be used both offensively and defensively. Jet will also ride light-cycles, both the classic cycle from the 1982 film and a new &quot;experimental&quot; update from designer Syd Mead (also responsible for the original light-cycle design).",
