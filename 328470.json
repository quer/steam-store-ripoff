            "reviews": "“Slave Zero is a great game, marred only by its sometimes laughable difficulty level. If you’re into this kind of thing -- and who isn’t into wholesale slaughter of innocent, err, I mean, sentinels? -- you should pick it up. You won’t regret it for a minute.”<br />\r\n90 – Game Vortex<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“There blows the neighborhood: Slave Zero puts you in control of a hijacked 60-foot biomechanical war machine geared to overthrowing SovKahn, an evil dictator who rules futuristic city S1-9 with an iron fist and a buttload of robots. Equipped with rocket launchers and machine guns, you must destroy power plants, hovercraft, skyscrapers, basically any damned thing that gets in your way (which, let’s face it, is pretty good work if you can get it). And if pesky pedestrians get underfoot, just give a mighty stomp and hear them squeal and squish. Hey, we just said it’s a revolution — we didn’t say it was a nice friendly revolution.”<br />\r\n80 – Maxim Magazine<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“All in all, Slave Zero is a quality title -- and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a solid single-player experience, and it's a shame they couldn't find a way to include multiplayer support. Everybody needs a title in their library that they can just pick up, jump right in, and hit the street shooting. Slave Zero is one of those games, and it's worth the purchase for that alone.”<br />\r\n80 – IGN<br />\r\n",
