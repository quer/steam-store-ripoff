            "reviews": "“Great graphics and sound; multiple realism options make it as challenging (or as easy) as you like. Much horsepower needed to keep it airborne; learning the controls can be time-consuming. Microprose has scored a direct hit with it. If you enjoy modern air-combat sims, this is definitely for you.”<br />\r\n88 – PC Gamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Fleet Defender is pitched against the 'big boys', namely Falcon 3 and Tornado - and it holds its own on all fronts other than the just mentioned graphics. However, there's sufficient depth, realism and playability in the game to help you ignore the nightmare ripple effect.”<br />\r\n86 – PC Zone<br />\r\n",
