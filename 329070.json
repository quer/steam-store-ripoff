Hecker has seen the game trigger strong emotional responses. I even felt it… guilt of all things. I’ve killed thousands — millions? — of enemy characters and even some friendly characters in video games with none of the pangs of consequence. I shot one innocent partygoer in Spy Party after tracking them for a few minutes, after being sure they were Chris Hecker’s avatar and up to no good, and then, as they lay dead on the floor I realized I was wrong. I felt bad.”<br><a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5500968/the-next-smart-video-game-only-lets-you-kill-once\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>“SpyParty is like nothing else I’ve ever played. … When the laser focuses on you, the tension is intense.
