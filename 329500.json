I found Spacecom even more exciting and involving than most triple-A games recently. I would highly recommend it to all people who like good games.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"http://de.ign.com/spacecom-pc/95403/review/review-zu-spacecom-strategie-kann-so-einfach-sein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN Deutschland</a><br><br>“Spacecom is simple, both graphically and mechanically—so simple it could almost be a board game.  And yet despite—or rather, because of—this unassuming exterior, there's a lot of depth for you to explore within a limited space. That's the kind of strategy I like! It's like playing an actual game of chess where each piece has a very defined set of rules versus a weird game of pseudo-chess where each pawn functions slightly differently and you won't really understand the point of half of them until you're fifty hours in.  We like to say &quot;Graphics don't matter! Graphics don't matter!&quot; Well, here's your proof. Just bring your imagination to the table, and there's a deeply satisfying strategy game waiting for you.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2684902/spacecom-review-a-rousing-game-of-strategy-between-a-bunch-of-triangles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC World</a><br><br>“Spacecom is exactly what I like. Challenging, smart, addictive, stimulating and yet not overloaded with unnecessary things. Flow Combine &amp; 11 bit studios production represents the real meaning of strategy games and it’s essence. Every single fan of this genre, not only those with space theme, should check Spacecom.”<br>8,5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://gry.onet.pl/recenzje/spacecom-recenzja-male-jest-piekne-a-jakie-madre/pw3gd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://gry.onet.pl/recenzje/spacecom-recenzja-male-jest-piekne-a-jakie-madre/pw3gd</a><br>",
