How far can you run into the unknown before you need to catch your breath in a safe place? <br> <br>Each of the five DLC levels is a unique challenge all on its own, with achievements and unlockable skins awarded for completing each of them. Also unique to this DLC is a new game mode called Assault that can be played not only on all the new levels, but all the original levels too (once you've unlocked it!). Assault introduces rapid fire combat that will drastically change how you engage enemies and tackle challenges. To unlock Assault on a branch of original Cloudbuilt levels, simply complete the corresponding Defiance DLC level (for example, to play Assault on the Day levels, complete the Defiance level on the Day path).<br> <br>To unlock the initial four levels in this DLC, players must complete two levels in each of the four main branches.
