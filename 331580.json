Fair warning: it's weird and awkward, (and not always in a charming way), but hey, it's free right? So give it a shot anyway.<br><br>For everyone who bought the game before it went free, you've been granted the soundtrack DLC for free. The soundtrack is still $5. I left a price tag on it for people who think it's worth a damn and/or want to support me as a creator.<br><br>Thanks!<br>James Beech<br>Creator of ULTRAWORLD</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The doors to ULTRAWORLD are open and beckon you to return. Come see what's new in <strong>ULTRAWORLD EXODUS</strong>, a free addition to the wildly abstract first-person exploration adventure you've heard so little about. Created by a AAA game dev veteran that you've never heard of and certainly don't care about, ULTRAWORLD EXODUS is a relaxing stoll/Art toy/posturing philosophical treatise/who-knows-what.<br><br><strong>FEATURING</strong><br><br><strong>IMPERFECT</strong>: A highly revised redux of the original ULTRAWORLD story. Ponder Exoplanets and Artificial Intelligence while trying to assist a self-aware NPC in the midst of an existential crisis. Some people loved it. Some people hated it. Feel free to decide for yourself.<br><br><strong>EXODUS</strong>: A new continuation of the unusual sci-fi meta-narrative that could only be told in the medium of video games. A year has passed and ULTRAWORLD has changed. Your old pal is dismayed by your inaction, but this gives way to a new friend with an impossible plan. Embrace the future!<br><br><strong>VACATION MODE</strong>: A greatly expanded free-roaming mode where you're the Artist. Change the colors, filters, particles, and rendering modes for infinite visual variety (and I do mean infinite). Then soar above the landscape, camera in hand, looking for the perfect picture. Every shot is a unique abstract painting, created by you, and fit to hang on your walls.<br><br><strong>THE SOUNDTRACK</strong>: There are now double the songs to the highly praised original soundtrack.<br><br><strong>VR SUPPORT</strong>: Vacation Mode can be setup to use VR devices (although you'll need a steel stomach. Not meant for humans)<br><br>Now get out there and find your painting!",
