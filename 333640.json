All around you, moisture farmers tend to groves of viridian watervine. There are huts wrought from rock salt and brinestalk.

Further and beyond, the fabled Spindle rises above the fray and pierces the cloud-ribboned sky.<br><br>You clutch your rifle, or your vibroblade, or your tattered scroll, or your poisonous stinger, or your hypnotized goat.
