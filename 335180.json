This will be throughout Alpha as we believe a user wanting to purchase an open alpha game, should get to try out and test the current full state of the game first. We also need as many testers as possible, your reports, feedback and input is invaluable! <br><br><strong>So... why should you purchase the game if it's currently free?</strong> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Support the developers! <br></li><li>Purchased users will still have access to the latest updates when the demo stops being supported/updated in beta. <br></li><li>Get it cheaper! As more features are added, the price will progressively increase. This will benefit those who supported the game earlier. <br></li><li>We're adding upgraded only features to our Registry system, this will not directly affect any game features, however, it will give more access online. For example, blueprint hosting and multiple skin uploads for selection.<br><br>What are you waiting for? Click that demo button, and try out the full game for free!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>A voxel-based 3D sandbox set in the never-ending darkness of space. Create your own ships, explore new galaxies, stars and planets. Discover and salvage space stations, fight against pirates or opposing factions in multiplayer. Equip your ships with completely customisable weapons and conquer the galaxy. Trade and make a fortune, mass produce materials in gigantic factories. Design your very own space station. Create warp gates and network the universe at your front door. <br><br>The universe is a vast, mystical, beautiful, awe-inspiring place.... the universe is yours.<br><br>Built for scalability to facilitate massive fully interactable objects, almost anything is possible. Gameplay elements have been skillfully constructed to bring the ultimate space sandbox experience. <br><br>Dive into your own unique universe, and choose your path.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Procedurally generated infinite universe, with quadrillions of galaxies</strong> - The universe is massive. It'd take approximately 10,000 years to cross from one end to the other! Singleplayer and Multiplayer worlds can be heavily customised with our extensive config options.<br></li><li> <strong>Developed for scalability</strong>- We have a broad range of graphical and performance options that cater to our low-end users as well as those with heavy rigs and servers.<br></li><li> <strong>Advanced Build Tools</strong> - Powerful and easy to use building tools, quickly design awesome ships, stations and bases. Including functions: Copy &amp; paste, undo, redo, replace, symmetry modes, shape assistance systems (spheres, cycles, torus and more) and rotation of templates.<br></li><li> <strong>Modular Weapon Systems</strong> - Combine weapon systems for countless configurations of weapons. From sniper beams to swarm missiles.<br></li><li> <strong>Comprehensive Rail &amp; Logic Systems</strong> - Use the rail system to build moving parts. You can do anything from simple elevators, sliding or rotating doors,  to complex cranes.<br><br>Tinker with our logic systems to control any system in the game, be it weapons, lights, rails, or explosives. Logic covers all basic gate types for convenient use (AND, OR, NOT, DELAY, Flip-Flop), allows in flight control and wireless connections between entities.

Or, build complex systems like working clocks and even a real CPU.</li><li> <strong>Community multiplayer (dedicated servers)</strong> - Play with others in our community hosted servers.
