Being nimble allows the burglar to pick locks, bag bodies and answer pagers faster. They are also harder to hit in combat. They stay alive by staying out of the way.

Some prize blackthorn wood, while some might fill the head with molten lead. Others might bind it with leather straps, or cure it with animal fat.
