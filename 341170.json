Explore 8 initial world locations in any order as you build your character from a weak kid into a plausible video game hero.  Chris's floating mechanic allows for unique platforming challenges, and he can learn increasingly powerful spells and special moves as he travels the globe - as well as purchase upgrades from the merchants of the Kingdom of Lost Balloons.  Explore a world like something out of a Saturday morning cartoon, fight ninja cats and cyborg penguins, uncover a sinister story, and prove your capabilities to a skeptical population - with laughs along the way!<br> <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/341170/extras/Chris_Fireball_Gif.gif?t=1550497445\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY</h2>One day in 1995, seven children around the world mysteriously vanish, including a nerdy, overweight 7th-grader named Chris.  Finding himself in a remote part of Transylvania, he soon becomes lost in a Saturday morning cartoon universe of magic and villains.  When one of those villains transforms him into a helium balloon as an insult, Chris (ever the optimist) reinterprets his transformation as the superpower of flight, and floats off to save the other kidnapped children.<br> <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/341170/extras/World_Map_Gif2.gif?t=1550497445\" >",

You should give my adventure platformer game a try - I need your help to beat the Clan of the Black Yarnball, Large Urchin, and, of course, Count Junior. I mean, it's all his fault anyway.",
