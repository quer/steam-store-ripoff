Deity Quest takes you on this journey and beyond as you listen to various themes of the characters and locations of Aberos. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI was challenged to compose the music for Deity Quest with 8 and 16 bit sounds and fuse it with modern instruments. I feel that I have achieved this goal and incidentally created a new sound I can call my own. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy inspirations I drew from creating this album were mostly JRPGS that I have played when I was young on Game Boy and PSX. Such as Pokemon, Final Fantasy Legend II, Final Fantasy VII, Chrono Trigger, Dragonball Z: Supa Saiya Densetsu, Crusader of Centy. And others I have played as an adult like Final Fantasy X and Nier Gestalt. I give credit to all of the composers of those games because they are the ones that sparked the inspiration in the beginning before I became a composer. Thank you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of my best friends, Michael Muranaka, aka DJ Muranaka got a sneak peek of the album and was so inspired by one of the tracks that he did a remix of it. It is titled, &quot;City in the Sky (Muranasty Remix)&quot;. He also did the album cover art. Santiago Ocampo, the artist for Deity Quest, did the logo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would like to thank David Maletz for being super reliable and reasonable with my schedule for the opportunity to do music and sound for the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'd like to also thank Leslie-Anne Snipes for always believing in my talent, my art and listening to double the hours of all this music while I composed, mixed, and mastered.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDeity Quest Original Soundtrack is an album by Chase Bethea containing 1.27 hours of music.
