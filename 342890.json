By taking the synonym of a word, and then a synonym of that synonym, and so on, you can ultimately arrive at any other word in a language.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game supports multiplayer, and weekly challenges in which users can compete globally on set start and end words. Every time a path is uncovered by a user, it is tweeted from @synonymygame and posted to our Facebook page. All profits go to educational charities. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA visualization of the game's network can be seen here -- http://tinyurl.com/med6g8b -- In order to compute relative distance, all synonyms were mapped using 3d graphing software, as if each word were a planet that had a gravitational pull proportional to its number of relationships to other nodes.
