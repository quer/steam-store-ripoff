[...] This is a game I'd play again and again so I could pretend like I'm in the 70's in New York or just experience the intricate details of trains. This game is as good as other World of Subways volume's I've played and definitely not your run of the mill train simulator. It aims to create a specific experience for you in depth. I really like it and think you will too.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.flightsim.com/vbfs/content.php?16264-Review-World-Of-Subways-Vol-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.flightsim.com/vbfs/content.php?16264-Review-World-Of-Subways-Vol-4</a><br>",
