She followed Ecco from her hive in deep space back to this new, nourishing planet. Now, plunging into the warm waters of Earth, she seeks out a deep chasm and sinks into the abyss, where she feeds upon the Earth as she spawns streams of Vortex young.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  Her feeding builds in strength, creating a downward current against which small fish struggle in vain. She is creating a new Vortex race, and her presence on Earth bodes doom for all its creatures!<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ecco must rid the world of this engulfing evil. Even as he tumbles in the waves, the future is unfolding. But must it be a dark future ruled by the Vortex and – lifeless, miserable and cold?

For it is not just his dolphin pod at stake, but the Earth and all living beings!",
