Occupying the island called 'Hibernia' by the Greeks and Romans, they were first recorded in the Greco-Egyptian writer Ptolemy's 2nd century AD treatise on 'Geography'. Making their home on the eastern shores, the tribe settled between two river estuaries - the Buvinda and Oboca, approximately where the city of Dublin now lies.<br><br>Relationships between clans is what drove barbarian culture and society, as clans intermarried, traded and warred with one another. Tribal life in Gaelic Ireland revolved around the clan, an extended family built on kinship, loyalty and, generally, a common ancestry. Hibernian clans were supposed to have been descended from one man, the authority to rule passing down the male bloodline. This means that most clansmen were of the same blood, although fostering and adoption were as common as in other parts of the world. Clans were led by their chieftain, who sat at the top of a strict hierarchical social structure.<br><br>Much like the Picts of Caledonia, the tribes of Hibernia have never been conquered by the Roman Empire, though they have traded with it - as evidenced by the discovery of Roman coins across the island. From their well-positioned, defensible capital the Ebdanians control their own destiny; they could rise to rule over the Celtic world, and none on these fair isles - or beyond - will be able to deny them!<br><br>Caledonians<br>The Caledonians are northern Britannia's first line of defence against Imperial Rome, and bar the way north for any would-be invaders. Although their true heritage has been much debated, they are believed to be an amalgamation of Pictish tribes and those fleeing the Roman advance into Britannia, surviving mostly in a series of hillforts and farms stretching across the highlands of Scotland.<br><br>Unfortunately, most historical sources on the Caledonians are of Roman origin, with the usual Roman bias in the reporting; for instance, Tacitus refuses to use terms such as 'king' to describe the Caledonian leader Calgacus, although this may be because he was unsure of their internal hierarchy. They are first mentioned by Tacitus as fighting at the Battle of Mons Graupius, which they lost once the Legions forced them from the hills into an open field battle, as opposed to the guerrilla-style tactics naturally favoured by the rocky terrain. In mentioning the Caledonians, Tacitus also describes them as the stereotypical definition of red haired, long-limbed “northmen” - furious and barbaric to a man.<br><br>In the centuries following Mons Graupius, the Caledonians have remained a belligerent thorn in the Empire's side, constantly crossing into Britannia to raid - and often successfully. Despite dogged Imperial efforts, they steadfastly refuse to be cowed, and stand now against a darkening world, poised to take back what is rightfully theirs!<br><br><br>Picts<br>The Picts are resolute defenders of their homeland, which lies at the far north of the Britannic Isles. The Romans tried for many years to bring them under control - the Emperors Hadrian and Antoninus even resorting to building walls across the country in order to control the passage of, and trade between, Imperial subjects and the savage, tenacious &quot;northmen&quot;. The  general focus on defence during Hadrian's tenure has led some to the notion that his wall was more than a mere trade gateway - it was intended to keep the Picts and other Caledonian peoples out.<br><br>Broadly, the Picts remain an enigmatic people who left no written records behind. However, we know they fought hard and against the invaders because the Roman historian Tacitus made specific references to their defiance in his 'Histories'. It is also likely that 'Picti' (in Latin) was simply a general term used by the Romans for any number of northern tribes whom they considered &quot;painted ones&quot;, in reference to the common Celtic tribal custom of tattooing and painting the body before battle.<br><br>The Picts were part of the ill-fated Great Conspiracy of AD367-368, when barbarian raids were co-ordinated with the desertion of the Roman garrison along Hadrian's Wall, and almost succeeded in wresting power from the Empire in Britannia and northern Gaul. Now, on the cusp of the 5th century AD, the Picts must rekindle old alliances if they wish to take their country back. Britannia, and indeed the Empire at-large, awaits the outcome - could this be the beginning of a unified Celtic empire in the north, one that will sweep away Roman oppression once and for all?",
