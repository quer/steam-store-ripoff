Dragan may be a former cop, but he's a former Croatian cop, which means his methods make the MPDC look like timid babysitters. He was brought to America and accepted into the PAYDAY gang as a favor to The Butcher. While there were some early suspicions regarding his true loyalties, his ability and commitment are indisputable.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/344140/extras/bom_perkdeck.png?t=1516114982\" ><br>•\t<strong>Infiltrator perk deck</strong> – The Infiltrator is an agent hired by a government or large criminal organization to obtain information about its enemies, or by a corporation to obtain industrial secrets from its competitors.

The whole rifle body is a mono-block construction made from high impact polymer. When looked at from the front, it looks something like a bugle.

Cleavers have a long history of butchering human beings as well as livestock, as the Chinese Triad consider the Cleaver something of a trademark weapon. Easily concealable, inexpensive, and a marked effect on both the target’s psyche and body.
