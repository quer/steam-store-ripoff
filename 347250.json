            "reviews": "“On the C64, Project: Stealth Fighter was 'a near perfect flight simulator, succeeding through accuracy, realism, depth and atmosphere'. On the PC it's all so much better thanks to MicroProse's considerable talent in using the host machine's capabilities and surrounding it with top-notch presentation.”<br />\r\n95 – The Games Machine (UK)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Compulsive, addictive and ruinous to your social life. Only a couple a packages can compare with this. The graphics are quite superb and the manual makes enthralling reading, even if you never go near the game.”<br />\r\n91 – The One<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“The same engrossing gameplay as the ST, and a graphics mode to suit every PC. Not as hot a sim as LHX, but an excellent package nonetheless.”<br />\r\n89 – Computer and Video Games<br />\r\n",
