            "detailed_description": "&quot;Wait&quot; is a mystery horror game, inspired by the works of H.P Lovecraft and the Silent Hill series.<br>The gameplay is put together by elements of exploration and riddle solving.<br>We want to offer a different kind of horror. A horror without jump scares or fighting monsters, but with the fear of the unknown and unimaginable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is &quot;Wait&quot;?</h2><br>The game is all about atmosphere and we wanted to support that by giving the player the opportunity to interact with almost every object at different times during the game.<br>It's about exploration and discovering what is happening around you. <br>Everything in &quot;Wait&quot; is experienced by a young man, the player knows nothing about. And it's intended to be that way. <br>You are literally thrown into another mans life and you can find out more about who that man is, by exploring.<br>His behaviour, his characteristics are slowly revealed through interacting with objects or continuing with the story.<br><br>&quot;Wait&quot; may be inspired by the Cthulhu mythos created by Howard Phillips Lovecraft, but doesn't actually take place in it.<br>There are some references here and there, but what was most important to us was the feeling and the atmosphere Lovecraft created in his stories - the fear of the unimaginable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About the project</h2><br>We originally created &quot;Wait&quot; for the 2014 Indie Game Maker Contest. It was a contest in which you had 4 weeks to create a game, using any official engine. Since the contest was hosted by the RPG Maker Team we decided to go with their engine. <br>Although the engine was made for roleplaying games, we saw potential for an adventurous horror game. <br>During development we grew fond of our little project and once the contest was over we didn't want to let go. <br>There was still so much we wanted to implement, but due to the time limit of 4 weeks we could only do about half of it. <br>That's when we decided to do an extended version to &quot;really&quot; finish the game, add more details, enhance some visuals, erase plot holes and add some more story content. <br>But that's all just supplementary. &quot;Wait - Extended&quot; has the following features:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">     <li> Atmospheric exploration gameplay<br>     </li><li> Alternative endings<br>     </li><li> Dynamic replayability (Successive playthroughs will not be same)<br>     </li><li> Achievement system<br>     </li><li> Hidden storylines</li></ul><br>We hope you will have as much fun with &quot;Wait&quot;, as we have working on it.
