This medium has been an endless source of delight for me, as the soundtracks underscoring the many electronic worlds I have explored over the years have demonstrated to me that I am by no means alone in my desire: I long to share with others the joys of discovery, epic sensations of wonder and enchantment as well as the sweetness and beauty of unique aesthetics, environments and themes by painting colorful and fantastical landscapes in sound.<br><br>I would say that the vast majority of my work (now over 1500 songs and counting) convey emotions existing on the “enchantment” spectrum.  My work is often dreamy, ethereal, soft, soothing, mysterious, meandering and (usually, but not always) joyful.  However, as seen in my BFS (Blob From Space) tracks, I like to sometimes write weird and fun, retro style video game music.
