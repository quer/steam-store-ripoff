The Survivor has formidable self-repairing, ore extraction and production, and research and development ability. If in such danger or if unable to contact with the ground, the Survivors can also support their independent exploration and research underground. As expected, after entering the cave, they are disturbed by a strong energy. In a great shock, the members have fallen into a coma, and Drilling Trucks went out of control.
