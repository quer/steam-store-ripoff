Both nomads in their own way, the animalistic Khan and the fearless Jackal represent the ultimate challenge for Stronghold players.

After The Wolf is impaled and thrown from his tower at the end of the original Stronghold (2001) he is taken east, where he is miraculously restored to health by The Jackal and his allies. After mending his broken bones The Jackal eventually becomes The Wolf’s subordinate, earning his master's trust by killing the King and replacing The Pig as chief warlord. Unlike The Pig or indeed The Rat, The Jackal appears unafraid of The Wolf. Disagreeing with orders and seeking to provide counsel in his own way, The Jackal challenges The Wolf as an equal. After his military campaign against The Boy fails, The Jackal chooses to desert his stubborn leader and return to his native lands.
