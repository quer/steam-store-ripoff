Bolstered by great art and voice acting, it was never boring even as I spent hours with all the tower's inhabitants, slowly but surely deciphering their back stories.”<br><a href=\"http://kotaku.com/littlewitch-romanesque-the-kotaku-review-1679149817\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>“Jast USA have shown that there are still hidden gems to unearth in visual novels from the last decade. This is one of those gems.”<br>A- – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.otakustudy.com/visual-novel/2014/12/girlish-grimoire-littlewitch-romanesque-visual-novel-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Otaku Study</a><br><br>“Not only is the magical storyline interesting but the cast of distinct characters really bring the world to life. This is counterbalanced by a surprisingly addictive gameplay system which pairs luck with strategy in order to take on tons of quests. In absence of adult content, the game still stands tall as both its storyline and gameplay are excellent. There’s no need to lure players in with sexuality, unlike some other titles.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/04/16/review-littlewitch-romanesque-editio-regia/144588/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >HardcoreGamer</a><br>",
