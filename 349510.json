AI</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/349510/extras/coop_vs_ai.gif?t=1553493971\" ><br>Building a player base in an online indie game is a massive challenge. So we added a Co-op vs. AI mode and map allowing for 1-4 players to enjoy destroying AI across 4 different difficulties. We’ll be adding support to our existing maps as quickly as possible.<br><br><strong>Skill Trees (Per-Match Leveling)</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/349510/extras/skilltrees.gif?t=1553493971\" ><br>We’ve wanted skill trees for years in the game, and they’re finally here! Choose between Active Skills, Movement Skills &amp; Stat Skills to customize your play style per-match. (Similar to MOBA’s). This system introduces Movement Skills (called Talents in game) like double-tap dodges/dive rolls and double jump.<br><br><strong>Rivals &amp; In-Match Player Dueling</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/349510/extras/rivals.gif?t=1553493971\" ><br>To make the online experience more engaging, we’ve added Rivals and In-Match Player Dueling. Rivals allows a player that’s killed you repeatedly to be tagged and grant bonuses for avenging your own deaths. Player dueling allows you to challenge an opposing player to a protected duel to the death that other players cannot interfere with.<br><br><strong>Other Patch Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>All New Menus<br></li><li>Player Statistics &amp; Leaderboards<br></li><li>Steam Friends/Party System<br></li><li>Steam Achievements<br></li><li>Basic Server Queuing/Matching<br></li><li>Re-designed Capture the Scroll Maps (Yari Foothills and Shiga Forest)<br></li><li>Dozens of Bug Fixes/Quality of Life Improvements</li></ul></p><br><h1>Free Weekend</h1><p>Early Access v.3 + Free Weekend Starting April 4th - April 7th.
