            "detailed_description": "<h1>Just Updated</h1><p>Dear players,<br><br>All of us at Nacho games and Free Reign Entertainment are proud about the Burstfire game. We feel that we’ve been able to achieve a lot in a short time.  Burstfire was fun for us during both our internal tests and Open Alpha Summer 2015. <br><br>Unfortunately the game in it's current state did not get popular enough for us to provide quality updates for it. To put it simply – the game just doesn’t have enough players to be fun – you may notice when playing that it’s difficult to find players to join a full game session.<br><br>We think that by continuing to sell game right now we’re providing a disservice to our players that buy the game and expect an active player base.  To make sure that players are not getting a bad experience, we’ve decided to halt the sale of the game.  We are going back to the drawing board and redesigning the game to better fit player expectations. <br><br>For the next 7 days we will provide an unconditional refund to anyone who bought the game regardless how many hours you've played or how long ago you purchased it on Steam or other platform.  We will refund your purchase 100%, no questions asked :)<br><br>We’ll keep the game servers up and running as long as there are active players trying to play the game.<br><br>Thank you for giving us your vote of confidence and trying out Burstfire. We’ll be back with a new and improved Burstfire in 2016, stay tuned for more news!<br><br>Burstfire Team</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Burstfire is a tactical, competitive, first-person shooter that is a fusion of old-school tactical combat with modern design sensibilities that allow for a slower combat pace while maintaining a high level of excitement and fun!<br><br>Play as the attacking &quot;SWAT&quot; team to breach through enemy &quot;MERC&quot; defenses using tools such as the &quot;Breaching Charge&quot; or the &quot;Hacking Device&quot; to carefully, and precisely capture your objective, the enemy &quot;INTEL COM&quot;.<br><br>or<br><br>Play as the defending &quot;MERC&quot; team, setting up defensible positions around the &quot;INTEL COM&quot;, your primary defense objective, using tools such as the Wooden Barricades and Wall Reinforcements. <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Twelve unique weapons to take into combat, each with their own unique feel and playstyle and balanced so that not one weapon has too much strength over the other.<br></li><li>Equip tools for your operations to perform feats such as destroying weak walls and structures, hacking and disabling enemy devices, slowing enemy advances and more!<br></li><li>Play your way!
