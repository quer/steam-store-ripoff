It's you versus an ever increasing onslaught of geometric foes. Literally render them into pixels with devastating weapons and abilities including missiles, mines, magnets and dash. Evade, outlast and play with style in Shwip's three main game modes, then take to the couch and play against your friends in Shwipball – a competitive battle arena inspired by air hockey. Post high-scores that dominate global leaderboards so you can show your friends and strangers alike who’s boss.

So we've given a few cool modes to ensure maximum levels of fun and excitement for everyone. <br>  <br><strong>Arcade</strong> <br>Going out in 15 minutes and need a quick particle induced fix? Buckle up, buddy. This is three minutes of increasingly difficult enemies spawns and swarms with one objective; to turn you into dust. Arcade features all the weapon types but no ship improvements, so you better be ready. This is the arcade mode you grew up with and love, so post those high scores and show the world you are the Shwip master. <br>  <br><strong>Style</strong> <br>Currently a work in progress and will launch with Shwip coming out of Early Access. Our original vision for this mode didn't translate well, so we are taking on a new approach.<br>  <br><strong>Minefield</strong> <br>You’re placed in an desolate environment with a wounded ship, a damaged weapons system and a serious case of home-sickness. There are mines scattered everywhere, and a series of energy fields you need to fly through in order to maintain your ship's integrity. Sound hard? Well then, we're keeping the best part a secret. <br>  <br><strong>Practice</strong> <br>Choose the enemy type and frequency and unleash your might. Great for learning how to gain style points or just to mess around and show off new skills to your friends and family. There are no time limits, so customize your gameplay experience and get your particle fix for the day.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enemies</h2> These enemies will have you fiddling with your controllers in ways you never thought possible. Take solace in the beauty of their particle ridden demise. Shwip features a range of enemies from floaty pawns to pack hunting, pixel-thirsty units.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapons</h2> From industry standard cannons to the Shwip. We give you an awesome array of cool weapons and abilities to use and abuse. Pro-tip : Each weapon has an alternate use. From a whip, to missiles, to mines, to boosting, to blasting to magnets. Destroy your enemies as you please!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Online Leaderboards &amp; Stats</h2> Compete against the world and track global stats on our website and in-game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2> Trash-talk and taunt your friends and family in real time without delay with Shwip's local multiplayer. We grew up playing Mario Kart, Worms and Halo in cramped rooms with tiny CRTs, and we want to bring back that magical feeling. Three single player modes and two competitive versus modes await you and your squad.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controls</h2> Honestly? We recommend Shwip be played with a gamepad. Keyboard and mouse does indeed work, but it's not how we suggest you play the game.",
