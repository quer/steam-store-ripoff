Players choose from 6 distinct robot characters of varying personality, ability, and weaponry, forming two teams of 3 robots. Players must work with their teammates to attack enemy robots until they are turned into bins of scrap, then transport the bins back to their base as scraps for recycling. It’s capture-the-flag where the players are the flags!<br><br>Once a team has collected enough scraps, they can create the mighty giant robot, El Rey Gigante Robo Jr., and unleash him to destroy the enemy base and win!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE STORY</strong></h2><br>After years of making a mess of things, mankind has finally given up and left Earth to find a new planet to trash.<br><br>Left behind were the machines that once dutifully served their human masters.
