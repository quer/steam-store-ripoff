We designed Pixel: ru² with modern computer technology in mind.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">120 Hz</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351170/extras/store-120hz.png?t=1498155650\" ><br>Pixel: ru² is designed to be run at <strong>120 frames per second</strong>.  If needed, it can be rendered at a lower framerate through the video settings to reduce GPU load, but it will still internally be running at a smooth 120 Hz.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4K</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351170/extras/store-4k.png?t=1498155650\" ><br>Pixel: ru² may look like a low resolution game, but it's actually designed for a <strong>4K display</strong>.  Anything smaller results in the graphics being scaled down to fit correctly.  This means that instead of the graphics being stretched or duplicated for scaling up, they are blended together smoothly for scale down.  This results in a much nicer looking experience for all resolutions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FLAC (requires DLC)</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351170/extras/store-lossless.png?t=1498155650\" ><br>If you purchase the soundtrack DLC you will be provided with <strong>lossless versions of the in-game music</strong>.  Having the soundtrack installed will allow Pixel: ru² to play lossless tracks instead of the Ogg Vorbis files it comes with.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RGB</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351170/extras/store-keyboard.png?t=1498155650\" ><br>Have a keyboard with RGB LED's in it?  We designed Pixel: ru² to take advantage of them by doing <strong>colorful effects on your keyboard</strong> while you play the game resulting in a more immersive experience.<br><br><u>Here's a list of hardware we currently support:</u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Corsair Gaming K65 RGB<br></li><li>Corsair Gaming K70 RGB<br></li><li>Corsair Gaming K95 RGB<br></li><li>Corsair Gaming Sabre RGB<br></li><li>Logitech G910 Orion Spark<br></li><li>Philips Hue<br></li><li>Razer BlackWidow Chroma<br></li><li>Razer BlackWidow Tournament Edition Chroma<br></li><li>Razer DeathAdder Chroma<br></li><li>Razer Firefly<br></li><li>Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma<br></li><li>Razer Mamba Tournament Edition</li></ul><br>Learn more at: <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://LEDL.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://LEDL.io</a></p><br><h1>Steam Greenlight</h1><p>4,572 of you wanted us on Steam and here we are!<br><strong>Thank you for your support.</strong></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2><br>We live in an amazing time. Computers are becoming smarter and more powerful, and more tangible items are being turned into digital data. Science predicts that within the next hundred years artificial intelligence (AI) will be as smart as humans. Imagine the possibilities if this trend continues for thousands of years. <br><br>In the distant future, AI will be so common in technology that even a single pixel in an image file may be controlled by one. Pixel: ru² is a tale of a sentient pixel that is tasked with eliminating a virus and restoring corrupted image files. Being a pixel isn’t easy; you’ll face infected pixels, puzzles that require color and gravity manipulation, and precision platforming challenges. You can complete your mission as efficiently as possible, or you can let your curiosity lead you to bits of information that may reveal the bigger picture.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2><br>Pixel: ru² (are you squared) is a game that is a combination of a platformer, a shooter, and a puzzle game. The gameplay features color theory based puzzle and combat mechanics and gravity manipulation based puzzle and platforming mechanics. There are a lot of simple systems stacked on top of each other which makes it easy to learn, but difficult to master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Access</h2><br>Since Pixel: ru² was first conceived, we've been deigning it for be a competitive game.  You don't need to compete to enjoy the game, but we built the score system around players competing with each other on global leaderboards.  To help make sure everything is balanced, we're providing access to the game early.  This will allow us to see what needs to be adjusted to help make the game better overall.  We do plan on <strong>raising the price as we add more content</strong> to the game.  If you'd like to purchase the game at a discount, buy it now before it goes up in price.  Doing so will also help you shape some of the game's mechanics.  If you're not willing to take the risk on an Early Access title,",
