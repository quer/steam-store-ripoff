Thanks to the descriptive writing, it’s easy to lose yourself in the story and even without the help of those excellent illustrations – from the same artist who worked on An Assassin in Orlandes – mentally visualizing your world is easy and very rewarding.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2011/05/review-gamebook-adventures-catacombs-of.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+DigitallyDownloaded+%28Digitally+Downloaded%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Digitally Downloaded</a><br><br>“In many ways, the gamebook really emphasizes the game aspect, since it’s all-in-all a very interactive experience. The book part of the equation is really well-done too, however, with a very well-written story and some interesting and compelling characters.  An excellent mix of compelling story, branching choices for exploration and replayability, fun RPG elements and lots of random outcomes to keep you on the edge of your seat!”<br>Proxholic<br>",
