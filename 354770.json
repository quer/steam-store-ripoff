It’s got stunning visuals, intriguing lore, and a perfect variation of both levels and enemies. This was made in GameMaker. Yeah. Unbelievable.”<br>8.5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://decryptedgaming.com/all-review-list/trigger-saint-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Decrypted Gaming</a><br><br>“Sometimes, the best games you play come out of nowhere, with zero hype and zero notice. Trigger Saint was a game I had never even heard of, but as soon as I got my hands on it I was an instant fan. Challenging, rewarding and beautiful, even in it’s early access state, it’s a great title that really does deserve your attention.”<br>N/A – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://shoddypixels.com/indie-focus-trigger-saint/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Shoddy Pixels</a><br>",
