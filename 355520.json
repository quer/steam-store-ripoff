            "reviews": "“Hands down one of the craziest games I've played. The character banter was awesome, the story is just out there sometimes, and I can see myself replaying this game more than once...because it's quite possible to miss a lot of things this game has to offer on the first playthrough.”<br>7.4/10 – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HkSilYd_lQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >EndlessXGaming</a><br><br>“I’ll give this game 4 out of 5 stars. This game was really, really funny, and really, really entertaining. The characters were lovable, and all and all, I just had a great time playing it. It was not in The Tokyo Dome nor was Misawa in it, so I can only give this game four stars, though.”<br>4/5 Stars – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLutQRqszz0ovgJJwRV4ZFXcGL8-RGzg9n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >ScheLPs</a><br><br>“Running time around ten hours, the game really doesn’t overstay its welcome, so it’s a really good pick up and play game. As well, if you just wanna play it from start to finish in one go, you’re very welcome to do so. You don’t need that much grinding...So, yeah, pick up and give it a try. Albino Hunter—it’s right now on Steam so you can get it. …The selling point that got me into the game: it’s not expensive. … And honestly, for the price it had, it’s very well worth it…[T]his is a game I would have loved to be able to play twenty years ago, when I was a little kid, and I would have loved to play something like this on the Super Nintendo. You know, it’s games like these that I say, twenty years ago [if] this would have come out for the Super Nintendo, it would have been so famous. It would have been comparable to a Final Fantasy because…back in the day, not many games were too long…[A] ten hour RPG is just, honestly, the sweet point for me.”<br>10/10 – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk_TaLzbR2U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >ARMR Studios</a><br>",
