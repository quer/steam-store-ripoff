Multi-car pileups are common, and on occasion you’ll need to avoid cars falling from the track above you. The track designs can get pretty wild, with huge jumps, trap doors, and Sonic-style loops to speed through. And the whole thing is rendered with a colorful, low-poly, retrofuturistic style that makes it feel almost like you’re zipping through a sci-fi city ripped out of Tron.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/18/13987822/drive-drive-drive-review-ps4-steam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Verge</a><br>",
