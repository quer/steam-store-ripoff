A piece of drum-loaded mobile artillery that brings pump-and-thump action to your table and explosive mayhem to the next. Add our Millionaire’s Bacon for a sweet and salty maple treat. When you’re so hungry you feel you could rip a skulldozer in half with your teeth, we suggest ordering the 12G ‘Steakout’ shotgun. Lovingly crafted from organic polymers, layered with locally sourced stainless-steel, the ‘Steakout’ brings the sharp kick you want.
