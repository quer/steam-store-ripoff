Well, we at OVERKILL are proud and excited to bring you a party that is guaranteed to heat things up and blow away the winter blues – the smokin’ hot BBQ Weapon Pack. Featuring a loaded menu of fresh treats – fiery weapons, mouth-filling melee, and a heaping side of new ordnance. And what would a party be without cool masks, materials and patterns? We got them too!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/358150/extras/bbq_pack_banner_firearms.jpg?t=1531928334\" ><br>•\t<strong>Piglet Grenade Launcher, 12G Steakout Shotgun</strong> – A popular menu item with grandparents and children alike, the ‘Piglet’ grenade launcher is a classic. A piece of drum-loaded mobile artillery that brings pump-and-thump action to your table and explosive mayhem to the next. Add our Millionaire’s Bacon for a sweet and salty maple treat. When you’re so hungry you feel you could rip a skulldozer in half with your teeth, we suggest ordering the 12G ‘Steakout’ shotgun. Lovingly crafted from organic polymers, layered with locally sourced stainless-steel, the ‘Steakout’ brings the sharp kick you want.

Dripping with delicious thickened pyrophoric fluids, smoldering with smokin’ ignition topping and capable of spraying eye-watering hot sauce up to 20 yards, the Flamethrower is one of our most served dishes. See that skin sizzle!

Nothing more than a breakable bottle of flammable liquid with a ‘fuse’ replaced by a burning rag. It is cheap, simple and highly effective. Enjoy with jalapeño poppers. Other than that, we've also taken the liberty of adding incendiary ammo.
