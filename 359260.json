Word of warning: If you are looking for the usual storyline, crowded HOG scenes, Map, journal, standard puzzles and mini-games, sparkles that show you where to go and a hint system that is helpful, this is NOT your game.I loved the story which may seem a bit out there; I loved the graphics and funny enough, I relly did enjoy the Music. This game was one of the most challenging games I had played back when I was a novice to the adventures genre.”<br>5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/games/5391/green-moon/?pc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Bigfishgames</a><br><br>“his game was quite an adventure and I enjoyed every minute!
