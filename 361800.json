You can be a lord who rules a huge grand territory or makes a knight guild to protect the ToL world. What about a village for wanderers? Whatever you want!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/361800/extras/1st.jpg?t=1545783830\" ><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The one beautiful world.</h2><br>Yes, our world is not perfect. It is full of dangers. So, it could be a good way to explore the ToL world in your room. What about the desert? Come and feel the sunshine, chase a mirage, find unique cactus and shooting stars… If you prefer the North Pole than the desert, why don’t you explore the snowy field on the North? Please keep in mind that you should bring your warm leather clothes. (… be careful with bears!) Can you feel it? Just explore the world!<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player-based Economy</h2><br>Are you tired of endless battles? But you still want to support your guild as one of guild members? If so, be a master, then move the entire economy of ToL. Build and maintain your own farm, then generate food to support your guild. Or just be a grand merchant, then transport goods across the whole world, or be a master who makes good weapons in legendary level. Whichever is fine. That makes the economy.<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">21 Class combinations</h2><br>World best warrior in the realm, legendary master, 5-star chef… You don’t really know which one fits you? Well, have you ever thought why you can’t be a mighty warrior and 5-star chef at the same time? Like... a chef who catches a big brown bear with his bare hands. As you want, you can be both of them N.O.W, since there are 21 job classes in the world! YAY~~~ You can make your own character as you like.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/361800/extras/2nd.jpg?t=1545783830\" ><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Be a friend or be a foe.

You can be a good friend with other players, or just be a night watchman to protect the new world order, or offer a reward for criminals to bring the justice. Depends on your choice. However just be careful.
