            "detailed_description": "Sydney's World is a family-friendly JRPG. Game focus is on the intersecting story arcs of a young girl seeking her father and a king in search of redemption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSydney is a real eight year old girl, not a cliche fem super-hero or cliche fem helpless victim. She behaves just as the real Sydney would, alternating between cuteness, petulance, innocence, anger, sorrow, illogical decisions, jealousy, extreme joy, etc. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen she's captured by an evil wizard and transported to another world, her toy elf Snowball is brought to life. He's Sydney's alter ego and ultimate childhood wish-fulfillment; his whole existence revolves around her. Together, they stop small dogs from barking, cause a king to reconsider his philosophy, and deal with very real emotions in a fantasy world setting. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKing Nicholas Westergaard rules the human settlements of an unknown world. He's consumed with a war against another race and a rebellion within his own kingdom. In time he discovers he has caused both. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplore new worlds without the usual multitude of boring side-quests and random encounters with identical enemies. There are no maps, mini-maps, mini-mini maps, or micro-maps; exploration is done the old-fashioned way, with clues and logic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSydney and villains are voice-acted to enhance engagement. Other characters are not, to encourage reading and imagination. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is no profanity, blood/gore, sexual content...or even more damaging to young minds...lame dialogue and cheap endings!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOlder, wiser players will enjoy unconventional aphorisms that might cause them to reconsider their own philosophy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHard-core RPG gamers should note that there is no inventory management or traits/abilities/skill point management. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information on Sydney's World for younger players, please visit the website.",
