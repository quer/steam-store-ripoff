Users can also export games for the following platforms:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Windows/EXE<br></li><li>MacOSX/APP<br></li><li>Android/APK<br></li><li>iOS/IPA<br></li><li>HTML 5 for Web Browsers</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>BUILD YOUR WORLD WITH AN IMPROVED MAP EDITOR</strong></h2>RPG Maker MV uses a user-friendly​ map system to help you build the RPG world of your dreams.

With RPG Maker MV, your game will allow the player to play the game with a flick of their mouse, or using a touch screen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SEE YOUR GAME IN HIGHER RESOLUTION</strong></h2>RPG Maker MV can show more than ever before. With a default 1.5x the resolution, sprites can show more emotion and the scenery can be more detailed than ever before.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>USE PLUGINS TO MAKE A FULLY CUSTOMIZED GAME</strong></h2>Want to customize your game even FURTHER? Use plugins to change things the way YOU want them. You can get them from us, get them from other fans, or master JavaScript to make your own!
