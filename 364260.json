The level map, items, monsters — every aspect of your in-game surroundings changes, creating the potential for unlimited replay ability. You’ll encounter unique bosses and a horde of tough monsters. In addition to the four base classes, over ten mixed character classes with their own stats and skillsets can be unlocked.
