Like the Deluxe Edition, this includes both the game itself and the soundtrack. In addition, you get a digital art and lore book with a lot of background info about the game, its art and its creation, as well as our very first legendary item in the game, complete with a look of its own and a unique background story: Fangshire.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/365360/extras/Fangshire.jpg?t=1543511964\" ></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/365360/extras/store_header_3.png?t=1543511964\" ><br>Battle Brothers is a turn based tactical RPG which has you leading a mercenary company in a gritty, low-power, medieval fantasy world. You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?<br><br>The game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/365360/extras/features.jpg?t=1543511964\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Manage a medieval mercenary company in a procedurally generated open world.<br></li><li> Fight complex turn-based tactical battles with historical equipment and brutal injuries.<br></li><li> Permadeath.
