In addition, for no charge, all WarBirds Online players have access to a TeamSpeak 3 server. This allows online players to use voice communication within the game. <br><br>While WarBirds Online is free, IENT is a business, so of course there are limitations. During the first month online, you have complete access to all features at no charge. After the first month, you can still play free, but you are limited to an early war plane set, which varies from arena to arena. To access the full set of all aircraft in all arenas, Steam players can purchase day, week or month passes, which range from $2.99 to $15.95. If you just want to play in a specific event on a specific day, the Day Pass is best for you. If you want to play with the best planes, against the best players, whenever you want, the Month Pass is your best choice.<br><br><strong>WarBirds 2018</strong> continues to dedicate itself entirely to remarkable historical accuracy and detail. After 22 years it is still one of the most impressive WWII combat flight simulations available. Choose from countless online scenarios, modes and options that give WarBirds a stunningly deep playing experience.
