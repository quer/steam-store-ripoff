With a propensity for partying and making music, he cruises the galaxy with his skybot Jib aboard the ship Songbringer, searching for verdant planets absent the presence of galactic police.<br><br>When Roq finds the nanosword hidden in a cave on Ekzera, he unwittingly awakens an ancient evil. The sword is pretty fraggin' sweet though.

Growing up, he took an interest in programming artificial intelligence, eventually making a career for himself. On his deathbed, he illegally transferred his consciousness into a skybot, destroying the consciousness link thereby preventing overwrite. <br><br>Jib scans the bodies of your fallen foes, sometimes uncovering valuable loot. He can also gain the ability to stun foes. Jib is automatically controlled by AI, or player two can play Jib in local co-op mode.<br><br>Lacking the ability to grow one as a human, Jib is obsessed with mustaches. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/367080/extras/SteamScene7.png?t=1528911826\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedural</h2><br>You choose a 6-letter world seed when beginning a quest.

It’s a the type of game that is addictive and fun and you can easily start playing it at midnight and next thing you know it’s 5:30 am and you have to get the kids up and ready for school in half an hour. [...] This is great in nearly every way and has put itself on a short list for consideration once it’s time for Game of the Year awards. Yes, I went there and you should to.

[...] It’s a feat of technical skill in more ways than one and offers countless hours of dungeon crawling potential.
