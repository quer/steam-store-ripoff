It’s her story, but it’s also your story. The murder mystery is as old as popular fiction itself, and territory video games have covered before, but I’ve never experienced one quite like this.”<br>90, Editor's Choice – <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a><br><br>“Movies can’t dream of offering audiences a narrative structure as intimate and involving as this: they’re just moving pictures.
