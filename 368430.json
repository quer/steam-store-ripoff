Not knowing what is in the dark, heck even knowing it is worse, adds psychological and subdermal layers fear, tainting every step throughout the luscious scenery.”<br>89 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamephasis.com/through-the-woods/review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamephasis</a><br><br>“If you’re a fan of survival horror games, Through the Woods is a mesmerizing experience you’ll want to encounter. Sometimes the deep emptiness of a rich forest is enough to give you goosebumps.”<br>80 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://nerdreactor.com/2016/11/03/can-you-survive-a-trip-through-the-woods-pc-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >NerdReactor</a><br><br>“It’s rare these days that any game comes close to emulating the walking nightmare nature of the original three Silent Hill games, but the ‘double protagonist’ of the real-time and voiced-over mother, beautiful yet desolate environments, and the jarring, painfully honest story make Through the Woods one of the most compelling horror games of the year.”<br>92 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://gametimereviews.com/game-reviews/through-the-woods-preview-for-pc-2016/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameTimeReviews</a><br>",
