All of the gameplay is generated by the music. It feals really futuristic. A good shmup is much like this. The game comes really alive with its different aesthetics.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.appspy.com/feature/9514/hands-on-with-beat-the-beat-the-indie-shmup-firing-on-all-dubstep-cannons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >AppSpy</a><br><br>“This all is accompanied by rhythmic music, to be exact the good old classic uhmts-uhmts-uhmts. The charges, that are flying towards you, seem to be giving birth to this music - meaning that depending on what melody is being played, you can understand how difficult the next section of a level will be. Strange, but after 10-15 minutes, you start to bob your feet to the rhythm of the melody”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://kanobu.ru/articles/nashi-beat-da-beat-vyinet-iz-vas-vsyu-dushu-i-vyipet-krov-mladentsa-369184/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kanobu</a><br>",
