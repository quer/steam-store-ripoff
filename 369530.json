What's unique?</h2>Like in most space sandbox games - in Void Destroyer 2 you start with a single ship then work your way up in the world. What's unique - a single ship isn't the end, the dominance of all you can see is. Your first ship is just a step on the path to a massive fleet, from tiny fighters to massive capital ships. Your thirst for power doesn't have to end there, you'll own bases and territory, hard won from their original owners. Use them to build fleets to expand and conquer.

As it stands within the week of its early access launch, Void Destroyer 2 is a very solid and fun game, but the knowledge that it is only going to get bigger and better the longer it is out and the more people buy it, makes this game a worthy investment of time. The dev is extremely open and active, and this instills great confidence in the ability to bring this game to its true potential.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.brashgames.co.uk/2016/10/01/void-destroyer-2-early-access-preview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Brash Games</a><br>",
