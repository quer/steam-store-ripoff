Honestly, you rarely even see games in the genre that take the time to provide animated sprites! The unique, frightening storyline stands out against its colleagues as well. If this review got you interested then definitely seek out Two Steps Back for yourself and unravel its mysteries.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://cliqist.com/2014/09/15/trapped-in-a-dream-with-two-steps-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Cliqist</a><br>",
