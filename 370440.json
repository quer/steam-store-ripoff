Some nights, there was just pure silence in the house. Happenings that we couldn't explain would occur in those nights, objects would change places frequently, and sometimes we would feel something passing by the door. One day, when I was passing by my grandmother's room, I noticed a small chest.<br>I reached for it but my grandmother got angry and hit my hand.<br>I had never seen my grandmother that angry before. And I never saw that chest again.<br><br>Do you want to help Aras? ''No70: Eye of Basir'' is a story based first person perspective horror and adventure game which focused on investigation.
