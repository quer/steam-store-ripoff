One day, when I was passing by my grandmother's room, I noticed a small chest.<br>I reached for it but my grandmother got angry and hit my hand.<br>I had never seen my grandmother that angry before. And I never saw that chest again.<br><br>Do you want to help Aras? ''No70: Eye of Basir'' is a story based first person perspective horror and adventure game which focused on investigation.
