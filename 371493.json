It's the latest design for the S-Bahn Berlin and currently the version that is used most. After reunification in 1990 the representatives of Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe and Deutschen Reichsbahn (the former operator of Berlin's S-Bahn network) joined forces in defining the specs for a new class. A first mock-up model was presented to the public in 1993.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the end of the German Democratic Republic came the opportunity to replace the rolling stock, which mainly consisted of outdated, pre-war class 475, 476 und 477 railcars. The average age of these railcars surpassed 40 years. Newer class 480 (West-Berlin) and class 485 (East-Berlin) railcars, which where obtained between 1986 and 1992, could have replaced the entire fleet. But they didn't meet the new requirements for operation and comfort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new concept saw a renunciation of the old quarter train concept and a re-establishment of half train configurations. The railcars are equipped with polyphase motors and GEATRAC-controls (AEG).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCommissioning of the first 100 trains was in 1993.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ministry of traffic ordered the lowering of the railcar's floors from 1080 mm to 1000 mm at the end of 1993.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first quarter train was introduced to the public in 1996 with a festive rollout at the main plant in Schöneweide.
