            "short_description": "Starship Rubicon is a modern take on the classic space shooter genre. It's a smart and challenging rogue-lite that features a unique control scheme, pixel art remixed with NASA photographs, and an existential crisis about who is REALLY the monster.",

Underneath there are a lot of fun mechanics that will feel familiar to experienced gamers. It would be easy to simply call this game a mashup of many other titles, but that wouldn’t do justice to what Starship Rubicon delivers.”<br>True PC Gaming<br><br>“Starship Rubicon is like FTL, Asteroids, and Luftrausers all got busy inside of a wool sleeping bag.”<br>10/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-starship-rubicon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Indie Game Bundles</a><br>",
