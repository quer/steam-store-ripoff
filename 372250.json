Keeping you going while all this is happening is an awesome 8-bit score rife with neat sound effects and an overall eerie tone.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://cogconnected.com/review/turnover-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >COG Connected</a><br><br>“Main character Clea is a mathematician – she’s not your typical muscle-bound video game hero. Instead of the use of crazy combat skills or weaponry, Turnover instead focuses on using your cunning and wit to survive. There’s a heavy emphasis on stealth, so you’ll need to put a lot of thought into each action you take.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.useapotion.com/2015/12/18/review-turnover/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Use A Potion!</a><br>",
