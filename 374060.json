If you enjoy a horror game with amazing pacing, real horror without having to rely on jump scares, and an outstanding atmosphere, go ahead and take a walk down Stairs.”<br>95/100 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.modvive.com/2015/09/28/stairs-review-hell-is-just-a-flight-of-stairs-away/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >ModVive</a><br><br>“STAIRS really impressed me with its ability to give me some decent puzzles, good scares, and not having to resort to jump scares every few minutes.
