Get access to this game now and get involved in its development!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Logo_SteamEarlyAccess.png?t=1553857638\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why Early Access?</h2>Many of you want to enjoy a real tram ride experience as soon as possible and explore the city on a challenging route. We want to make this possible for you at a sensible point in time when we have finished the essential contents of the route and nothing stands in the way of driving pleasure.<br><br>Since the LOTUS Simulator itself is still in the Early Access phase and therefore under development, we cannot yet integrate all the features and gameplay of the finished product. We make the highest demands on our finished product, which, however, still needs its time. Our add-on will grow directly with LOTUS and will be constantly updated with new functions and a comprehensive gameplay.<br><br>Therefore, we use all possibilities which the LOTUS Simulator base offers us so far and enable you to fully utilize them with our add-on.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The contents at a glance</h2>You can expect a lovingly designed and detailed tram model of the R2.2b of the MVG and a completed route 28, which will lead you from the Sendlinger Tor to the Scheidplatz.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Fahrzeugfoto.png?t=1553857638\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Liniengrafik_28.png?t=1553857638\" ><br><br>From the very beginning you can use the route 28 completely with all stops - the built-in IBIS and the corresponding announcements already work perfectly!<br>We have also already placed all the traffic lights and traffic signs on the entire route in detailed research and thus offer you an extremely realistic basis. You will be thrilled by the decorations of the stops and the quality of our house objects!<br><br>The Early Access is meant for all those, who already want to discover the driving fun with the Munich tram and want to look forward to new features, contents &amp; details in very short time intervals and regular updates and thus have a longer play fun.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Early Access-Timetable</h2>Early Access will start in the 1st quarter of 2019. First with tram R2.2b and line 28. <br><br>Line 27 will be added in the course of the 2nd quarter of 2019:<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Liniengrafik_27.png?t=1553857638\" ><br><br>At the end of the year there will be another extension with line 12:<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Liniengrafik_12.png?t=1553857638\" ><br><br><br>There will be an extended IBIS and CAD/AVL integration by fall of 2019, as well as timetable-connected AI rail traffic.<br><br>We will implement a special gameplay and offer the possibility for cross-platform use with smartphones and tablets. We will announce more about this in spring!<br>The final product with all features should be finished by the end of 2019 depending on the functionality of the LOTUS Simulator and will be further developed and supplemented.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Are there different costs to the final release version?</h2>The add-on will be available on the STEAM gaming platform from the time of the Early Access launch. You have the advantage that you can use the game early and explore the course. The price is reduced by € 29.99 at the start of Early Access and will be raised to € 34.99 at the end of summer 2019 for the final product.<br><br><br>All those who have already purchased the add-on for Early Access will receive all updates in between and the final release version automatically and free of charge via STEAM at the earliest possible time and thus have an added value compared to those who purchase the final release version first.<br><br>Additionally each owner of the Early Access version (and only those owners) gets a special and limited goodie: A Munich KI-Christkindl (Christmas) -Tram, which can not be purchased afterwards! So a special highlight and thank you gift for all our most loyal customers.<br><br>In addition you support us developers with the purchase of the Early Access version and make it possible for us to develop further products in the future.<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What will the final product include?</h2>Our product Munich Tram will include the following:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Tram R2.2b of MVG with fully functional cockpit and detailed interior design<br></li><li>Route 12: Scheidplatz – Romanplatz<br></li><li>Route 27: Sendlinger Tor – Petuelring<br></li><li>Route 28: Sendlinger Tor - Scheidplatz<br></li><li>Over 370 highly detailed building objects<br></li><li>Highly detailed streets and scenery design<br></li><li>Various AI vehicles<br></li><li>Original announcements<br></li><li>Timetables and new gameplay</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How is the community involved in Early Access development?</h2>We will be in direct contact with you throughout Early Access via our social media channels and the LOTUS forum, where we will receive your feedback, wishes, suggestions and also your opinion on our questions. <br>We look forward to a lively exchange with you!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Munich Tram - the first Add-On for the LOTUS-Simulator!</strong><br>For the first time, we offer you the possibility to control a highly detailed tram model in a realistic simulation on real tracks!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Simulation At A Glance</h2>With the tram type R2.2b you can take a virtual tour through downtown Munich and explore the routes of the lines 12, 27 and 28! Experience for yourself how it feels to take the tram through the Bavarian capital. The tram has a long tradition in Munich, the first tram line opened in 1876. But our simulation doesn't lead you that far back, because instead of the R2.2b there was still a horse-drawn tram on the way. About 120 years later, since the mid-1990s, the vehicles of the R2.2 series have dominated the Munich cityscape. The type R2.2b was comprehensively modernized from 2011 and is currently in use on Munich's rails in its redesign.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Fahrzeugfoto_Header.png?t=1553857638\" ><br><br>And exactly with this vehicle in the well-known blue design of the MVG you can become tram drivers yourself! Put your skills to the test - get into the driver's seat and you're ready to go!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Routes</h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Liniengrafik_12.png?t=1553857638\" ><br>Route 12 runs from Scheidplatz via Kurfürstenplatz to Romanplatz and is a link in the Munich network.<br>The journey time for the 16 stops in each direction is 21 minutes. The route also includes a very important operational loop for distractions and short tours: The Ackermann/Olympic Loop. This will also be included in the simulation and used with corresponding scenarios.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Liniengrafik_27.png?t=1553857638\" ><br>Route 27 runs in the heart of Munich from Sendlinger Tor via Karlsplatz, Karolinienplatz, Kurfürstenplatz and Hohenzollernplatz to Petuelring. The journey time for the 15 stops along the line is about 20 minutes. Past many famous sights, such as the Pinakotheken or the old Börse, time passes in a flash. Line 27 is not only in use during the day, but also at night. Test your driving skills in night traffic as well!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Liniengrafik_28.png?t=1553857638\" ><br>Route 28 also starts at Sendlinger Tor and runs via Karlsplatz and Karolinienplatz to Kurfürstenplatz. There, line 28 branches off from the shared route with line 27 and continues to Scheidplatz. The journey time for the 12 stops along the line is about 16 minutes.<br>Try it out! Become a tram driver yourself and drive through Munich on our lines.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Tram Model</h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/374871/extras/Fahrzeugfoto.png?t=1553857638\" ><br>Type R2.2b belongs to the R series, MVG's first low-floor tramway. After around 15 years in service, the R2.2 one-way vehicles were extensively modernised and went into operation in 2011 as the R2.2b series. Both inside and outside, the modernised model is available in a new design - blue and white aluminium. New handrails, extended passenger information and swivelling sliding doors characterise the redesign.",
