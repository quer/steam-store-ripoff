But you would be wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSLIDE is a hardcore 2d platformer where you run, jump and (often) die. No enemies, no blowing stuff up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat makes this game stand out - for better or worse - is a system of contextual jumps which allows to perform dozens of jumps simply by combining direction keys with the &quot;jump&quot;. You can even jump down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis feature not only makes for a unique paltforming experience but also adds a puzzle element where you need to figure out what jumps are available to you and which ones to perform in certain situations.",
