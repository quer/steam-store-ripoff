In addition to the strategic gameplay and management aspects, the fact that games play out quickly helped keep me going “just one more turn.” In that way, it is very much like bigger strategy titles, like the aforementioned Civilization series. Plus, it is polished and charmingly animated, with easy to read menus and a very helpful tutorial.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.operationsports.com/football-tactics-impressions-steam-early-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Operation Sports</a><br><br>“Think Heroes of Might and Magic but with footballers instead of griffins...”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thepixelempire.net/football-tactics-pc-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Pixel Empire</a><br><br>“A real innovation: deeply addictive”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamestar.de/artikel/football-tactics-early-access-der-koenigstransfer-fuer-fans-von-fussballmanagern,3321776.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.gamestar.de/artikel/football-tactics-early-access-der-koenigstransfer-fuer-fans-von-fussballmanagern,3321776.html</a><br>",
