SAGA has been running since 2008, when it revolutionized the genre. We call SAGA an MMORTS because you build cities, command troops, and manage resources like in a traditional RTS, but also go on quests, chat with your friends, join guilds, and trade like an MMO. SAGA is an RTS with battling similar to the Total War series, mixed with city building from Stronghold. Build your army by collecting cards found in booster packs, or trade in-game resources for them in the auction house.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Persistent World</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Design, build and expand your own kingdom.<br></li><li>Manage peasants as they collect resources to help you build and maintain your fortifications even when you're not online!.<br></li><li>Research and discover new technologies in your quest for total dominance.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customizable Units</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Your <strong><i>units level up</i></strong> and gain experience points that persist between battles.<br></li><li>Collect <strong><i>over 100 different kinds of troops</i></strong> and over 50 spells.<br></li><li><strong><i>Collect loot</i></strong> from fallen enemies to customize and improve your units.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Solo and Co-op Questing</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Join with friends in <strong><i>Cooperative Mode</i></strong> or battle solo on <strong><i>over a thousand quests</i></strong>!<br></li><li>Create and join <strong><i>guilds</i></strong> which regularly give resource benefits.<br></li><li>Trade resources and troops with other players directly, using the Auction House, and with trade routes.<br></li><li><strong><i>PvP is completely optional</i></strong>, but participate in PvP for unique rewards including booster packs, troops, and items!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FAQ</h2><strong>I heard this game is pay to win.
