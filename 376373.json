The scrolls long for the day that their story may be told once more, so that all people of the world will once again know of the greed of the king. His nation may have crumbled, but the legend will last for all eternity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe &quot;From the Scrolls of XiPang&quot; Announcer can be activated from the character select menu or the in-game menu.
