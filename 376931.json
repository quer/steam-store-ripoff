In appearance, the Dash 8-32BWH is unlike anything else on the Amtrak roster, featuring a North American wide cab set in front of a traditional road-switcher body. When built, the locomotives were dressed in a flashy red, white, blue and grey Amtrak livery.<br><br>At first, Dash 8-32BWHs were assigned to short-haul trains, such as the Los Angeles-San Diego San Diegans, as well as premier long-distance trains including the California Zephyr. Since the arrival of Amtrak’s Genesis diesels, the Dash 8-32BWH, now dressed in Amtrak’s current blue and silver livery, has primarily been assigned to short-haul trains and often serve as terminal switchers at locations such as Miami and Chicago. <br><br>The Dash 8-32BWH for Train Simulator is available in both its original Amtrak livery and present-day scheme, and also includes a set of Amtrak Superliner passenger equipment. The locomotive is ideal for passenger duty on US routes from coast to coast! <br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Amtrak Dash 8-32BWH on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
