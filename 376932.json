As a result, the Western Pacific was constructed to exceptional engineering standards that featured numerous high trestles, bridges, and tunnels, and a routing that topped the rugged Sierra Nevada Mountains with an eastbound ruling grade of 1 percent. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/376932/extras/screen1.png?t=1467972643\" ><br>Train Simulator’s Feather River Canyon route recreates the dramatic Western Pacific main line from Oroville to Quincy Junction, California, as it existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the route also includes a segment of the Inside Gateway (Western Pacific’s important connection with the Great Northern and later Burlington Northern) from Keddie to Crescent Mills, as well as the trackage of the lumber-hauling Quincy Railroad short line. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/376932/extras/screen2.png?t=1467972643\" ><br>The route brings to life the remarkable locations and features of the Feather River Canyon, including famous Keddie Wye and Spanish Creek trestle, bustling Oroville yard and roundhouse, the iconic rail and road bridges of Pulga, and the nearly countless tunnels, such as the “Honeymoon Tunnels” near Belden, that Western Pacific’s visionary builders used to form the WP into a railroad engineering marvel.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/376932/extras/screen3.png?t=1467972643\" ><br>Included with the Feather River route are General Electric U30B and EMD F7 diesels in Western Pacific’s flashy orange and silvery livery and a selection of period-authentic freight rolling stock including a Western Pacific bay-window caboose.  <br><br><strong>Scenarios</strong><br><br>Seven career scenarios and eight railfan scenarios are included for the route: <br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Keddie Consignment: Part 1<br></li><li>Keddie Consignment: Part 2<br></li><li>Keddie Consignment: Part 3<br></li><li>Crescent Mills to Keddie<br></li><li>Oroville Bound: Part 1<br></li><li>Oroville Bound: Part 2<br></li><li>Oroville Bound: Part 3<br></li><li>Plus 8 railfan scenarios </li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
