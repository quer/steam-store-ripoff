The Transrapid is also the fastest commercial train currently in operation, with a top operating speed of 430 km/h (270mph), although the train recorded 501 km/h (311mph) during testing.<br><br>Unhampered by intermediate station stops or any other kind of traffic on the line, Maglevs operate a regular service at 15 minute intervals from morning to night, with a capacity for 574 passengers in each consist. The built-in ATO system, which allows the driver to hand complete control over to the Maglev’s electronic control systems, allows the service to operate automatically over the entire journey, including switching lines at the end and returning on the opposite track. This all means that the Transrapid can manage without certain commonplace railway items such as colour light signals, a horn or even windscreen wipers.<br><br>Despite years of development and many failed Maglev projects, only three commercial systems operate today.
