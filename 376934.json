The DD35 was a cabless booster (B unit) locomotive that consisted of two GP35 prime movers and electrical systems, mounted on a common frame and covered with a single cowling, riding on a pair of 4-axle Flexicoil trucks. As such, each prime mover powered a single set of four axles instead of two sets of two axles, as in the GP35.<br><br>Being a ‘B-unit’, the DD35 lacked any sort of cab and could only be run on the main line when connected with another ‘A-unit’ to control it. The four-axle truck was considered too harsh on the trackwork to be in the lead, and thus EMD’s response to UP’s request was a four-unit (instead of the requested 3-unit) locomotive set, consisting of a pair of 2,500hp GP35s sandwiching a pair of DD35s to make one 15,000hp locomotive set.<br><br>The DD35 was initially quite unreliable and were among the last EMD road units to be built with DC generators and old-fashioned switchgear, which were more maintenance intensive than later AC/DC equipment. Once teething troubles had been surmounted, the DD35 was reasonably successful but less flexible than smaller units and thus all original B units were withdrawn by 1977.
