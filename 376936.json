Plans were drawn up for a railway that would cut through the scenic Black Forest to reduce the journey distance by about 90 km. However despite the benefits of this line, it was deemed that the complex and expensive construction of the route and all the structures required would not be possible to build. The main struggle for builders was the incredible height difference throughout the Black Forest, and how to avoid a gradient steeper than 2% at any point which locomotives would not be able to cope with.<br><br>Luckily some 20 years after the plans were abolished, a plan was put forward using numerous hairpin loops and curving tunnels carving through the landscape to avoid laying track over the steep gradients. By 1863 the construction of a railway line through the Black Forest had begun and would take about 10 years to complete.<br><br>The most difficult section of the Black Forest Railway to construct was between Hornberg and Sankt Georgen.
