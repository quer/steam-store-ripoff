They originally worked in the North-East of England but were later transferred to Wales and South-West England. Based on a Walter Alexander bus body, the ‘Nodding Donkey’ was introduced to the rail network in the mid-1980s and is well known for its unsophisticated bouncy ride and meagre seating, faithfully recreated in this model. <br><br>The Class 158 was introduced by British Rail in 1989 as part of the programme to replace ageing heritage DMUs still in service. With an aluminium body, the DMU was dubbed the ‘Express Sprinter’ as it was designed to accelerate rapidly between stations, making it ideal for stopping services where new tighter timetables could now be introduced. With a top speed of 90mph and comfortable interior furnishings, it was also intended to be capable of handling longer services with ease. <br><br>The Arriva Trains Wales DMU Pack for Train Simulator contains both the Class 143 and Class 158 in Arriva Trains Wales livery and the bonus Class 158 in First Great Western Livery. <br><br>The DMUs are also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Class 143 and Class 158 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.
