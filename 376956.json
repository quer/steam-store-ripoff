These units were also designed with the environment in mind, meaning up to 95 percent of the EMU is recyclable once they reach the end of their lives.<br><br>The BR 440 was a development on the popular BR 424/425 S-Bahn EMUs with modern day improvements such as moving most of the underfloor equipment onto the roof of the unit, this resulted in a consistent lower floor, providing step-free access from platform to car. With this low floor design, the BR 440 was designed to cater for disabled passengers including spacious areas for wheelchairs and disabled toilets for those who need them. The other main advantage of moving the underfloor equipment was it was kept well above the track, making maintenance easier and reducing the risk of damage due to the excess ice that can build up around the track in the colder months.<br><br>The Train Simulator DB BR 440 ‘Coradia Continental’ is available in Deutsche Bahn Traffic Red Livery and recreates the EMU as it operates today for DB over the Munich – Augsburg route.
