When the GP35 debuted, it represented the latest in Electro-Motive’s extraordinarily successful line of four-axle (B-B) “GP” (“general purpose”) diesel road-switchers.<br><br>The list of GP35 customers read much like a railroading “who’s who” of the time, and among the railroads which purchased the landmark diesel was the Western Pacific, which between 1963 and 1965 acquired 22 of the versatile freight-service diesels. Western Pacific’s GP35s were originally dressed in WP’s eye-catching “Zephyr” silver and orange livery. Following the discontinuance of the California Zephyr in 1970, the Western Pacific adopted a new green color scheme. In 1980, most of the WP GP35s were rebuilt by Morrison Knudsen and soon thereafter joined the Union Pacific roster when WP was merged into UP. <br><br>Created by DTM, the Train Simulator Western Pacific GP35 is an authentic re-creation of this landmark locomotive and includes the WP GP35 in its original stylish silver and orange livery and in the WP’s 1970/80s green livery, making the locomotive suited to service across several decades on the WP’s Feather River Canyon route. The GP35 features highly authentic controls and operating features, as well as details specific to the WP locomotives. The Western Pacific GP35 add-on pack also includes WP 50-foot boxcars and three-bay covered hoppers and four career scenarios for the Train Simulator Feather River Canyon route.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2>Four career scenarios for the Feather River Canyon route (available separately) feature challenging mainline freight and switching duties:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Quincy Switcherman<br></li><li>Descending to Kramm<br></li><li>Finishing the Trip<br></li><li>Local to Crescent Mills</li></ul><br><strong>Please Note: The <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/376932\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Feather River Canyon Route Add-On</a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.</strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
