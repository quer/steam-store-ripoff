A total of 2 pre-production locomotives were built, 10 001 and 10 002, and while mainly similar, 10 001 was built as a hybrid-firing locomotive, taking both coal and oil in the newly designed 2’2′ T 40 Tender. 10 002 featured oil-only firing, and 10 001 would one day be refitted in such a manner.<br><br>The new BR 10 locomotives rolled out of the production line in 1957, very late as far as steam is concerned, and was ready for testing and main line operation throughout the unelectrified routes in Germany.
