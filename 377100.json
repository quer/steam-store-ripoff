            "short_description": "A subterranean puzzle-adventure game inspired by 90's era. There’s no handholding, no in-game menus, no messages from the devs, no tutorial. Some call it a marvel; some call it a good test for Steam's refund system. Certainly it’s not an easy game. Do you dare to puzzle? Just play savvy.",

The amount of times that I made discoveries on my own and spent my time committing to researching the little tricks feel great. First impressions count for a lot and though I was disappointed initially sticking it out was ultimately worth it. I haven’t played a game that has felt this rewarding for overcoming those initial obstacles in a long time.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.steamified.com/2016-indie-underearth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >STEAMIFIED</a><br><br>“This game is a marvel. When talking about independent games, some automatically think of conversions of mobile games on computers, but it's not that at all, far from it. When I talk about independent games, I mean the games on the first computers where classics were made ​​by 1, 2 or 3 people, rarely more. Now when I'll talk about independent games, I'll also mention UnderEarth .”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.graal.fr/2016/07/12/test-underearth-la-version-pour-steam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.graal.fr/2016/07/12/test-underearth-la-version-pour-steam/</a><br>",
