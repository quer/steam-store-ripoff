Michiru is dumbfounded, while Kazuki merely remarks: &quot;I never thought it would come so soon...&quot; Just what could be heading their way?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis visual novel, a spinoff of the popular &quot;Fruit of Grisaia&quot; series, follows Michiru's adventures in an anime-like format of 13 episodes.
