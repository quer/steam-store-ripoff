            "detailed_description": "<strong>Ymir is a 4X multiplayer strategy game combined with a city builder where each player develops a civilization of Pigmen starting at the stone age. </strong><br>The game is divided in 2 main interfaces : a worldmap view and a regional view. Each world tile matches a unique procedurally generated isometric zone that can be explored, settled and built on by players. In each one players can find random resources such as ores , animals or plants depending on the climate, relief and vegetation of the region. <br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>* Pigs with clothes. <br>* Multiplayer on local or persistent servers. <br>* Complex socio-economic simulator for a challenging city-building experience on its own. <br>* Fully procedural worlds where each region is random and unique. <br>* 7 biomes, each one with its own specific resources to encourage player-trading. <br>* Advanced diplomatic and economic tools to setup treaties ( right of passage, taxes, payments, trade agreements... ) and trade routes between players. <br>* Real-time battles.<br>* WILL remain free of any pay-to-win . <br><br><strong>Economy:</strong><br>* No direct control over population and economy: They breed, age, work and buy things according to the simulation. <br>* Population divided in social classes with specific incomes, purchasing power and revenues.<br>* Dynamic resources prices based on supply/demand, rarity and production costs.<br>* Even player consumed resources are taken into account: materials for buildings have to be bough at their market prices, generating incomes to the producers and affecting the economy.<br>* A simulator instead of a set of independent game rules : all variables and actions influence each other in sometimes unpredictable ways that makes things frustratingly challenging. <br>* Producing too much of something can be as damaging as not enough making the logic of the game quite different from classic management games. ( ex: instead of having positive effects, distributing a new resource can actually destabilize your economy if you're not careful )<br><br><strong>Military:</strong><br>* Real-time battles are not instantiated and actually take place in your cities. <br>* Build and customize your fortifications with walls, bridges, gates, stairs, towers and battlements.<br>* With the terrain tools, modify the terrain heights to take maximum advantage of natural defenses like cliffs and hill tops.<br>* Water forces troops to embark and cross with slow vulnerable rafts: dig canals around your forts, secure your bridges or build a citadel on a river-island with fortified bridges. <br>* A Strategic-tool allows players to design their local defensive strategy in each one of their cities in case of attack: creating defensive zones, setting troops initial deployment positions and setting their behavior in battle.<br>* Battles are not instantaneous and belligerents can send reinforcements while a battle is still in progress. <br>* Battles can include unlimited 'teams' at the same time, each one fighting according to its allegiances.<br>* Battle troops during a battle are all AI controlled ( so that battles can happen independently of the player's presence ).<br>* Dozens of unit types including mounted camels, elephants and mammoths.<br><br><br><strong>2 game modes:</strong><br>* Real-time mode : a 'classical' mode to be played alone or with a few friends, meant to be played with the permanent presence of all players and to be stopped/continued over several playing sessions.<br>* Permanent mode : a more &quot;MMO&quot; mode where the game server is to be left running 24/7 at all times even when players are offline and where actions take much more time than in the real-time mode. Meant to be played with the maximum number of players on a day-to-day basis, with games lasting several weeks.",
