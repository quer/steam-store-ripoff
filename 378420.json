Operate a successful dinosaur park by attracting many visitors. Join the community and build your own creation! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt takes only 2 minutes to build a Zoo: http://youtu.be/NKEDTb0mOV8<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreate your own unique tour with different stations so visitors can observe the dinosaurs. The more likes you collect the more funds you accumulate (a heads up: locating the dinosaurs drinking and feeding bowls close to the stations is key). With your extra earned cash, expand the park with further services and amenities for visitors, such as gift shops, hotels, restaurants, while you are also in charge of securing food and water supplies, electricity and a necessary security system. A volcano nearby and unpredictable weather are additional challenges to manage your park successfully. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd don’t forget: dinosaurs can escape and chase visitors! So make sure to build safe heavens and provide swift assistance and evacuation for the visitors to safely operate your park. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course the happiness and well-being of the dinosaurs are of equal importance. Build them comfortable, clean enclosures with many plants, rocks, and lots of food and drinking spots. No visitor wants to see a sick dinosaur! Did a Dino escape? No worries, you will have a variety of tools at your disposal to catch them and to restore the operation of your park.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey features:<br />\r\n● authentic simulation and endless arrangements, <br />\r\n● 9 different type of meat and plant-eating dinosaurs,<br />\r\n● 15 different buildings,<br />\r\n● unrestricted construction of road and animal enclosures,<br />\r\n● a variety of challenges and scenarios, <br />\r\n● share the favorite pictures of your park with your friends,<br />\r\n● excellent sound-effects and 3D animation<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Jurassic Island: The Dinosaur Zoo Question and Answer:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Will I get notifications all the time and is this an online game?<br />\r\nA: No and no! We will never send you any notifications and drive you crazy with messages. The gameplay is totally offline so you can play anywhere anytime of the day. :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ: Is your company another giant willing to create similar games all the time?<br />\r\nA: No. We are a very small team of 4 really enthusiastic and creative people. We work in a tiny office and try to create games that people will love to play.
