Specials are powerups that can be activated in-game. They vary in duration and function and have a certain power level. The specials are described in the select menu before starting the game. <br><br>While in-game you have four specials per run, of which three can be chosen from the select menu whereas the last one (the most powerful one) is locked. <br>A particular type of specials are &quot;Allies&quot;. Allies can be summoned to back you up while fighting the evil. Examples of allies are the Hawk and the Husky.
