Massive aberrational topiaries obstruct the view of the heavens, blocking out the sun, casting the world into a vast, ominous abyss of shadows. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMutated fauna roam the Earth looking for prey: to devour … and to assimilate. Adapted to an post-apocalyptic life style, they are a deadly threat to your survival. The horrid creatures you encounter here in this time and place are impervious to conventional methods of human defense. Innovation and Problem-Solving are the only tools available to you for tactical, strategic evasion of your hunters. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith no memory of who you once were, you will grapple with different moral choices throughout the game. You will also confront the decision of who you want to become. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFlickering visual memories of your past begin to appear to you, but they exist only as the non-linear fragments of a story that was once your life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to your amnesia, you have begun to suffer the effects of a strange illness which rapidly destroys your health. <br />\r\nWhile trying to uncover the memories of your own past as well as the horrid fate of humanity itself, your main desideratum must be to acquire medication, or an antidote, to save yourself. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany events are randomized throughout gameplay. Even if you make the same choices that another has, you may likely experience different outcomes. You will feel constantly unaware of what to expect, always on-edge, often finding yourself in situations that you never expected … or wanted. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis story is not “open world”, neither is it linear: there are many possible routes that will take you to different destinations. The moral choices you make will instigate the so-called “Butterfly Effect”; repercussions abound. Here, your decisions create your own destiny. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe paths you choose extend not only to the physical world, but also into the arena of the emotional and psychological. Falling into the depths of an excruciatingly lonely existence, you become morosely affected by your twisted and dark surroundings. How can you maintain resolve when there is no hope in sight?",
