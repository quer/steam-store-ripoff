The name Accu-Feel was chosen because this best described what this product does.You can even control how well or poorly maintained the aircraft sounds! Accu-Feel comes with an easy-to-use user interface enabling you to fine-tune your preferences in the air, on the ground and at sea. From the volume of wind noise caused by opening a cockpit window to the amount of drag experienced when landing on water, Accu-Feel allows you to control your FSX: Steam Edition experience in incredible detail.<br><br>Back in 2008, A2A Simulations released their first Accu-Sim aircraft add-on, bypassing the core physics engine and replacing them with Accu-Sim coding, providing a new level of realism. The next step was to add the Accu-Sim experience to core FSX aircraft, and this has been achieved with Accu-Feel. Accu-Feel enhances the FSX:Steam Edition flying experience without touching a single file in the FSX directory, which ensures smooth operation without interfering with or altering add-on content.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Simple, safe non-destructive installation leaves all of your aircraft directories untouched (aircraft.cfg, panel.cfg, etc. are not changed)<br></li><li> Works with almost all FSX: Steam Edition aircraft.

You have more feel for exactly how well you are controlling your aircraft, both big and small. New side forces add even more dynamics when side-loading the landing gear.<br></li><li> Runway / pavement seams send dynamic jolts through your airframe that you can both feel and hear<br></li><li> Water physics including dynamic wave size and speed, adds immersion for those who love to land on the water<br></li><li> Turbulence modeling adds a feel based on our own experiences owning and operating aircraft<br></li><li> Physics-driven sound system<br></li><li> Cabin sounds from an old classic aircraft (bag of bolts) to the more modern, stronger pressurized tube liners, both on the ground and in the air<br></li><li> Dynamic wind gives a strong sense of how your aircraft is flying, giving feel to everything from a glider to a commercial airliner<br></li><li> Fuselage drag rumble is dynamically created, recreating the dropping of flaps, gear, or high pressures developed when approaching an airframe's Vne (Never Exceed Speed).
