Lukla is known as being the first port of call for those attempting to scale this massive mountain. <br><br>During the autumn climbing season, aircraft (mostly Twin Otters), only have fifteen minutes to land and take off again as there are only four parking spaces, making it one of the busiest airports in the world. It is also the highest airport with scheduled airline flights in the world. <br><br>Flying into Lukla is dangerous and complex, even in perfect weather providing a challenge for even the most seasoned pilots. Pilots soon learn that anything you do at this altitude needs to be planned and considered. Landing on the uphill runway means you have to flare in a completely different way. Taking off from the very short runway may only be possible because the runway ends with a 3000 foot drop into the valley below, complete with waterfalls.
