            "detailed_description": "Heinkel's He 219 Uhu, recreated for FSX: Steam Edition by A2A Simulations Aircraft Factory, is undoubtedly one of the most advanced aircraft to emerge from World War II. Conceived solely as a gun platform to serve as a defensive night fighter, the Uhu featured a bubble-top cockpit that was placed well forward, affording the pilot superb visibility. The cockpit was equipped with ejection seats, and was exceptionally well laid out.  All controls were easy to reach and identify. Combined with the tricycle landing gear, this plane was truly a &quot;pilot's aircraft&quot; and was very easy to fly. It was stable and predictable, exactly what one would expect from a night fighter. The earlier versions were adequately powered by the Daimler-Benz DB 603A, and had good rates of climb and acceptable top speeds approaching 400 mph. Later versions of the He 219, however, were much heavier, and because the more advanced, powerful engines were in short supply, these variants suffered in performance.<br><br>Ground-based stations would direct the night fighter to the bomber stream, and when in range, the Uhu's radar operator would then take over and guide the pilot to within 100 meters of the target. The bristling antennae were ugly and added a lot of drag, substantially reducing the aircraft's ultimate top speed. Without the radar, however, the aircraft would have been useless at night, and since the Uhu was still about 150 mph faster than the enemy four-engine bombers, this wasn’t much of a problem.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tCan be flown “by the book”<br></li><li>\tBuilt from actual aircraft tests<br></li><li>\tRealistic cruise performance with realistic fuel economy including “distance-to-altitude” performance under various power settings<br></li><li>\tAuthentic drop tank release actually drops both fuel and weight<br></li><li>\tBoth modern and veteran warbird pilots helped create the “feel” of flight<br></li><li>\tBased on the critically acclaimed Wings of POWER He-219 “Owl”<br></li><li>\tNative specular and bump mapped high-resolution lighting<br></li><li>\tCanopy and pilot seats eject<br></li><li>\tOxygen flow and tank gauges<br></li><li>\tAlmost every single item historically correct and clickable<br></li><li>\tAuthentic reflector gunsight with day and night settings<br></li><li>\tRetractable bulletproof windscreen<br></li><li>\tExtendable ladder<br></li><li>\tNaturally animated pilot and radar officer<br></li><li>\tProfessionally recorded and mastered engine sounds including realistic prop effects<br></li><li>\tDirectional 3D engineered sounds from A2A recorded sound from all viewing angles<br></li><li>\tStall buffet, canopy, ground roll, flaps, gyro, and authentic cockpit wind<br></li><li>\tSpecial canopy pressurizing and release sounds<br></li><li>\t“Special Effects” package includes:<br></li><li>\tHistorically accurate lighting for stunning night time visuals <br></li><li>\tRealistic start-up visuals modelled after the real aircraft <br></li><li>\tBelly landings with realistic effects<br></li><li>\tFull sized (11” X 8 ½”), 71-page landscape manual with authentic performance and function</li></ul>",
