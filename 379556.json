However, good looks were not enough and the Tiger was supplanted by the F8U Crusader, but not before the plane came to the attention of the Blue Angels demonstration team.<br><br>The Tiger was so reliable, photogenic and aerobatically capable that it served with the Blue Angels for a decade, long after the aircraft was retired from active duty with the Navy.
