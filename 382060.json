Design from the chassis up, then pit your creation against humans or AI in a combat arena.<br><br>Scraps lets you create a vehicle that’s great or a vehicle that sucks. Maybe your vehicle falls over when it corners or doesn't have enough power to fire its weapons – that’s okay. You decide what you drive. When you take out other players, you can scavenge from the wreckage too, and use it to repair or upgrade your own vehicle in-game.<br><br>Your design choices aren't just cosmetic - they're truly functional and at the very least affect the weight and balance of your vehicle.<br><br>In the full version you can Battle in single-player against the AI, on LAN, or over the Internet, plus easily host your own LAN or Internet games.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Language note:</h2>The only complete language at this time is English, but partial in-game translations are selectable for Russian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Romanian, and Swedish.",
