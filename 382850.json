Information Collected Through Technology</strong><br>We collect information through technology to make our Services more useful and interesting to our users, including without limitation:<br>Cookies. We may use cookies to track general, non-personal information about our users for statistical and market research purposes (e.g., user name, pages viewed, time spent on applications, websites visited just before and just after our Services, etc.). This information is collected on an aggregated and anonymous basis. Log Files. Like most Internet services, we may also use log files on the server side. The data held in log files includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit websites, device type, date/time stamp, and user activity (e.g., feature usage, user rankings, game statistics).<br>Temporary Files. In addition, the software enabling our websites may have associated log and temporary files that are stored on our servers. These files store your account information, preference settings, system notifications as well as other data necessary to enable you to use our Services. Your information may also exist within regularly performed server backups. This information is collected on an aggregated and anonymous basis.<br>Patches. When any game or application is updated or \"patched,\" our patch routine may check your device to see that you have the most recent version of the files.<br>On an aggregated and anonymous basis, we may also collect other information through technology, such as information on our users' hardware, operating systems, and usage patterns.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How We Use Your Information</h2>We may use the information we collect for a variety of purposes, primarily for operating and improving our Services. Our uses include without limitation:<br>Communications. Communications with you about your account and our Services, such as new features and offerings.<br>Services. Providing our Services, such as fulfilling requests and resolving customer support issues.<br>Analysis. Analyzing trends and user behavior to improve our Services and develop new Services.<br>Protection. Protecting our Services from misuse and, as may be necessary or appropriate in our determination, to protect the safety and security of our users, employees and third parties, or the integrity of our Services.<br>Finally, we may take your personal information and make it non-personally identifiable. We do this either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (e.g., your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. Given the non-personal nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to use de-personalized information.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sharing of Information with Third Parties</h2>We will not share your personal information with unrelated third party advertisers.<br>We will only share your personal information with third parties under the following circumstances:<br>Our Service Providers. We may utilize or partner with other companies to provide our Services, such as vendors and service providers that analyze customers' interaction with our Services, and handle consumer surveys, or companies that co-develop or co-publish games with us. While providing their services, these companies may access your personal information, but we will direct them to maintain the confidentiality of such information and use it solely for performing the applicable services. Required Disclosures. We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is required or permitted by law (e.g., court order or subpoena) or such disclosure helps (i) enforce our terms of use, contests, sweepstakes, promotions, game rules, or similar restrictions, or (ii) protect the safety and security of our users, employees and third parties, or the integrity of our Services.<br>Mergers and Corporate Transactions. In the event that we undergo a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, corporate divestiture or dissolution, a sale of assets, or similar transactions, we may share, disclose or transfer your information, including personal information, to the other organizations that are parties to such transactions.<br>Sweepstakes and Promotions. We may share your information in connection with any sweepstakes or promotions you enter in connection with our Services, as necessary to administer, market, sponsor, administer or fulfill them or as required by applicable laws, rules or regulations.<br>Offers. Our Services may display \"offers\" that are hosted by third party providers. The offers may, for example, provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your user ID, may be shared with the offer providers. Please be aware that, after clicking on one of these offers, you will no longer be on our Services, and information that you provide will go directly to the third party provider.<br>With Your Permission. Additionally, if you opt-in or otherwise agree to have your information shared with a third party (or third parties), we will share your information accordingly, in which case the third party's use of your information is subject to the third party's own privacy policy.<br>As discussed above, we may use de-personalized information in any way, including sharing it with third parties, without your consent. Among other things, we may share some of the information we collect from you upon installing a mobile application with vendors and other service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of Our Services and/or for analytics purposes which may require the reproduction and display of de-personalized information. You may be able to \"opt out\" of the collection of your information for third party analytics purposes by following the directions provided by our third party analytics vendor. If you \"opt out\" with one third party analytics provider, that action is specific to that provider only and does not otherwise limit our information collection under the terms of this Privacy Policy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Security of Your Information</h2>We are committed to safeguarding your information, and we implement reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information. We also constantly update our technology with the goal of better protecting your information.<br>While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will not occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe, to use strong passwords, to log out of your account after use, and to use different passwords for different services with different companies.
