You will have the opportunity to complete tasks unique to PARGs. You must be prepared: There is no virtual world, and you have no in-game avatar. You have an agent name, and the whole web to investigate for NPCs, fake websites and stories that blend the real word with our fiction. Several times during missions, you will be interacting with real world entities (players, businesses, organizations, etc.).<br><br>You will not be able to complete this game alone.
