            "detailed_description": "<strong>Expert Rifleman is the first 3D ballistics simulator available to the general consumer.</strong> It includes a full featured ballistics calculator allowing the simulation of any type of ammunition and simulates several categories of scopes including front focal plane, second focal plane, dual focal plane scopes and digital scopes. <strong>It even allows the user to design and load your own scope reticle.</strong><br><br><strong>The goal of Expert Rifleman is to let you gain proficiency at shooting stationary and moving targets without expending valuable ammo or barrel life. Use preloaded ammo types or create your own ammo by entering ballistic data.</strong> The simulation will let you practice shooting in different environmental conditions, try out zeros at different ranges and set the conditions under which your rifle is zeroed. Expert Rifleman features a realistic 3D environment where the user can train in scenarios not commonly available such as engaging long range moving targets and high angle shooting.<br><br><strong>The scope reticles in Expert Rifleman are calibrated in Mil-rads or MOA and function identically to the real thing. Learn how to use a reticle to range targets and calculate hold over. </strong><br><br><strong>The simulation allows the user to compensate for the forces which affect the path of the bullet.</strong> Vegetation sways and bends and particles follow the wind currents. You can visualize wind direction and intensity.
