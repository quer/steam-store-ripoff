It was originally meant to be one of the in-game area themes, but was at the end swapped out for sake of consistency and perceived lack of quality. It is included on this release for the sake of curiosity nevertheless. The closing track of the album is a reworked version of the very original 2012 trailer song. This version is also heard at the end of the game, or well, the first minute of it anyway.
