Odd looking plants have grown through the floor while you slept and an unsettling fog surrounds you. Outside you see a complicated path, and massive creatures made of stone.

You quickly turn to the chapter that describes where you're at and start looking for clues about how to survive. <br><br>Each new level has a new picture and description of the world from the book of Lamia. Use the book to learn about the world and solve the puzzles. Control the characters Lily and Thomas using a unique control system. Learn about why you're there and what eerie presence may be watching you.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/385310/extras/PagePromo.jpg?t=1458954759\" ><br><br>(Developers note, <br><br>The Land Of Lamia is a story driven puzzle adventure game. However, the story revolves around two characters (Lily and Thomas) who you'll be controlling simultaneously  with a unique mechanic.
