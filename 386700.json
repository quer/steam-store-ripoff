This is something to officially 'be excited about' - I know I am.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.indiegames.com/2010/06/exclusive_preview_the_oil_blue.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.indiegames.com/2010/06/exclusive_preview_the_oil_blue.html</a><br><br>“It's not common to see a tycoon game that goes for atmosphere, but The Oil Blue does just that, and it does it well....What it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in playability and raw intrigue. The Oil Blue looks great, plays great, and will suck you in for hours at a time. An excellent release from Vertigo Games!”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/review/the-oil-blue.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://jayisgames.com/review/the-oil-blue.php</a><br><br>“Games like The Oil Blue are always a pleasant surprise. We often expect nothing from them and they deliver an experience that is nothing sort of a joy. Vertigo games should be proud of what they’ve created here, and anyone interested in playing something great should check this out.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2010/07/02/oil-blue-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.gamezebo.com/2010/07/02/oil-blue-review/</a><br>",
