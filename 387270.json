Visit a total of 5 places of power in order to collect hundreds of items scattered throughout the vast world of Mystical.

To assist you, you're going to need to find gold to buy every item you need in your quest.<br><br>The more items you create, the more you learn. Gradually you will earn the title of scholar. Then you will gain the sacred keys that give you access to the secret rooms of Mystical. Behind these doors, 16 magical artifacts and 10 enchanted relics await you. Knowledge, mental alertness, dexterity and visual acuity will be among the essentials to accomplish these new tests. Maybe one day you'll have all these treasures...</i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Overview</strong></h2> <br>In Mystical, you must perform each trio and each twin within the time limit to win. A trio is a family of 3 items. A twin is the same item twice. Then for each trio, you have 3 twins. <br>When you play, each family of the current stage are shown at the top of the screen. You can scroll them with the right mouse button.<br><br>To perform a trio, you must buy each item within that trio by clicking on them in the main area. When they are in your bag slot at the bottom of the screen (15 items max), you can validate the combination by using a magnifying glass.<br>To perform a twin, you must buy the same item twice. When the twin is in your bag, you can validate it in the same way as trio. <br>You can put several combinations in your bag before validate them. You can buy the items out of the correct order but you will win more points if you buy them in the order shown.<br>When you do this, it is called a perfect trio. In the same way, to perform a perfect twin, buy the 3 twins in the correct order. The green lights under the families shown at the top of the screen will light if perfect trio and/or perfect twin matches are made for this family. I suggest you do them all... <br>Don't forget to pick up gold coins and magnifying glasses. Each item you put in your bag costs 1 gold coin and you will need magnifying glasses to validate the combinations in your bag.<br><br>You lose if you run out of time, if the central area is full or if your purchased item bag is full without any solutions. <br><br>Mystical has 5 levels of increasing difficulty. The levels are the village, the castle, the crypt, the temple and the dungeon. There are 10 stages for each level. The families of items are different and specific to each level. <br>For each stage, you can win a bronze, silver, or gold cup depending on your score. All stages can be restarted at will to help you improve your results (points and/or elapsed time). On the other hand, you must successfully complete a stage to access the next one.
