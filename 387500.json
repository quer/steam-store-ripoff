Their compositions are an international language that crosses all borders and overrides cultural differences.  \r\n\r\nThough they no longer exist as the Fab Four, their musical legacy lives on through generations of fans, and the thousands of tribute bands who “come together” worldwide, to interpret and perform their music.  There are an estimated 8,000 Beatles tribute bands globally who perform at multiple Beatle festivals and conventions throughout the world.  \r\n\r\nShot almost entirely in Liverpool, the birthplace of The Beatles, and captured in HD during International Beatle Week, Come Together is a tribute to that legacy…a phenomena that shows no signs of stopping.   Paul once said, “A hundred years from now, people will listen to the music of the Beatles the same way we listen to Mozart”.  \r\nImitation is the most sincere form of flattery. The lengths some tribute groups go to ranges from simple vocal harmonies, to what are affectionately called “Boots and Suits” bands.  Regardless of nationality, they attempt to look and sound as close to the originals as possible. The result is a creative composite of musical expression.  The documentary illustrates their diversification in sound and illusion.\r\n\r\nCome Together, moderated on-camera by John Lennon’s sister, Julia Baird, captures that sprit, motivation, energy and interpretation through in-depth interviews, rare footage, stunning concert performances, and personal stories by bands and fans alike.  People have come together from Tokyo to Stockholm to Las Vegas to share their love of the music of The Beatles and the positive and uplifting message it brings. This is their tribute to them as well.",
