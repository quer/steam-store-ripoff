Those that we know as mercenaries are the most amazing musicians in the other dimension, and they've enraptured countless worlds with their beats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the DJs enlisted in the ranks of the great music syndicate known as the Awesomenauts is called Rocco. He was once a rising star in The Intergalactic Symphonic Orchestra, but was ousted by a concertmaster who would not tollerate Rocco's ruthless freestyle jammin'. Refusing the back down and drop his aspirations of becoming a great musician, Rocco instead opted to drop the beat and joined the Awesomenauts, who welcomed him with open arms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nElectronic Supersonic Cybertronic Rocco is now one of the most prominent DJs in the galaxy, and uses his music to bring peace to worlds ruled by dissonance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Rocco in Awesomenauts. You need to have Rocco available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game.
