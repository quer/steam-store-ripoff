When he first tried this invention, it unleashed dragons, demons, and countless other monsters into the world… and a lot of heroes that wouldn’t do anything unless told specifically where to go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong these armored knights, boys in tights, and foreign princes, Yoolip found what appeared to be an 8-Bit version of himself… just sitting there, waiting for someone to take control of his destiny.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRealising he had just become the hero to a dozen different games at the same time, Yoolip took matters into his own hands and modified his invention to allow him to take control of his 8-Bit counterpart. Now he and his Robo Dinos are ready for some old school action!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Professor M. Yoolip in Awesomenauts. You need to have Professor M. Yoolip available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game. The 8-Bit Yoolip skin comes with a unique character theme, killing spree theme, a unique voiceover, and special in-game audio effects for his abilities.",
