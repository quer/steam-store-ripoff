Choose from the 100+ building parts you have at your disposal and create anything from crazy transforming vehicles to a house that moves.

Your job is to take care of the worker robots as they work the land, sending the food they produce to the metropolitan planets. Thing is, close to touchdown your spacecraft loses control and crashes, but since you’ve got luck on your side (erm…), you survive! You’re stranded though, and at first glance you find that not everything’s quite as it should be. The Farmbots working the fields have gone crazy, and now there’s only one way to stay alive: using your quick thinking, your creativity and your wily knack of turning your surroundings to your advantage.<br><br><strong>Let’s pop the hood and see what’s on offer right now:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Creative Mode! </strong><br>An unlimited amount of parts are yours to play with!
