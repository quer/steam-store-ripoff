What will happen to him, how he will behave, will he get home or not, all that depends on you. You will encounter a variety of creatures along your way, from roaches to huge scorpions, lizards and even small hamsters! Apart from living beings, you will see a variety of complex mechanisms. To overcome snow, forests, deserts and underground areas, you will require a good weapon. Though you already have that - a well-sharpened blade that will slice (almost) every monster.<br>The game requires you to plan every step, so that monsters won't have you for dinner. However, if you stand still, the monsters won't touch you. The &quot;Hardcore&quot; mode won't let you sleep, though, it will require your full attention.<br>If a friend of yours keeps bothering you, you can play a separate story about Jake and his brother together. You can walk through the same far-away places and see the same monsters, however, they will behave differently. If your friend gets lost, you will be able to show him where to go using the built-in chat and marker.<br>The game has an achievement system - try to unlock them all!
