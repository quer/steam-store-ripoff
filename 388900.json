Its a slower take on the genre. Lightening fast reflexes won't win the game but well placed buildings and well chosen upgrades just might do the trick!

The primary goal is to expand your territory and conquer your opponent's. Do this by planting flags to add to your area of control or taking out an opponents flag and erasing their influence, not to mention their buildings. Some territory is rich in resources other has tactical and strategic value.<br><br>Or you could just peacefully use the nearby trees for target practice... Can't promise that's a winning strategy, but all to their own!<br><br>Use siege weapons and hand delivered bombs to destroy opponents walls, flags, and maybe most importantly their economy. Stop a player's economy and you've got them by the tender bits.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Few More Details</h2><br>Each battle starts with a clean slate. All units, structures and weapons can be upgraded from a base level giving no in game advantage to more experienced players - other than of course their personal experience. <br><br>The early part of each game will be based around resource collection in order to build more weapons, add more workers and plant flags to expand. Resources are also used to upgrade effectiveness of all in game units. Siege weapons will become more accurate and more powerful with upgrades allowing longer range bombardments.

Better plant a flag. Want to be able to place siege weapons on top of a hill? Better plant a flag! Need another upgrade faster? Yeah, you better plant another flag.<br><br>If a flag is destroyed any buildings left without a flag nearby will burn to the ground.
