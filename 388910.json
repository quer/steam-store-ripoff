This isn't your typical tower defense - Not only will you build turrets and other defenses, you'll be jumping into first person mode and taking bad guys down yourself! <br><br>Using the unique skills of Sam, Kat, and Frank, you'll lay waste to the seemingly endless horde.  Deploy powerful automated towers, upgrade them to devastating Elite towers, and watch the mayhem.  When that doesn’t quite cut it, jump into FPS mode and activate the mobile gun platform - you'll become a deadly projectile as you move between structures, smashing any enemy that dares cross your path. To round out your lethal arsenal, place manually activated structures and rain down meteors and acid attacks. With an ever-expanding roster of levels, face off against 5 powerful enemy commanders, each with their own unique powers and buffs. From stealth to speed to heavy armor, you'll find yourself challenged every step of the way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mobile gun platform: boop, fly, kill</h2><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/388910/extras/Banner10.png?t=1529585807\" ><br><br>Ever been really, really mad at a creep that snuck past your defenses? As in, wanna smash-it-into-a-building mad? We hear you. With the mobile gun platform, you can do just that. When in FPS mode, press spacebar at any time to launch forward and throw creeps into buildings, walls, and even each other. Besides masquerading as a battering ram, you can use the platform to move to any structure on the map, booping creeps out of the way as you go. You can also activate meteor storms, cold snaps, and commander specials without ever leaving the comfort of your cockpit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Enemies and bosses with dangerous abilities</h2><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/388910/extras/Banner9.png?t=1529585807\" ><br><br>These creeps really want to destroy the world, and they do *not* appreciate your interference. They'll try everything they can do to sneak past your defenses, strengthen themselves against your attacks, or even attack you directly. Commanders like Guise will grant her forces stealth and allow them to sneak past your automated defenses uncontested. Brick and Aegis will keep their forces stocked up on armor and shields. But beware of Angel most of all - her icy artillery will freeze everything it touches, shutting down your turrets in a flash!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weapon modifiers: Make the ultimate creep-killing machine</h2><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/388910/extras/Banner1.png?t=1529585807\" ><br><br>As you advance in the game, more and more weapon modifiers will become available. You have your typical mods like decrease reload time, increase magazine size... but that's just the start. With advanced mods, you can start massively boosting strength of crit damage, or increase energy cost for a massive power boost. Some mods will help you against specific enemies, giving your weapons shield breaking or armor piercing abilities. The more you level up, the more mods you unlock, and even more are going to be added. The sky's the limit!",
