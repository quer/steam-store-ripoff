For the moment, with the support of our players, we were able to overcome all difficulties and bring the project to a completely new level of quality, while completely reworking it. In the game you will find a hundred square kilometers of the renewed world, 10 instances, a change of the time of day, customization, and also new characters, armor, enemies and NPCs, updated artificial intelligence, redesigned tasks and dialogues, initial character skills upgrades, a new interface, and new graphics.<br><br>The project will finally get frequent updates and will expand up to the release, but we want to note once again that the game is still in its Alpha stage, so it lacks many mechanics that will be introduced in the game gradually. The game was completely redesigned, which eliminated all previous bugs, but added new ones. For now, please do not consider the game as a full-fledged project.
