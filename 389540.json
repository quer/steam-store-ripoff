I worked on every last one to make sure it would look beautiful, perform great, and offer loads of entertainment. <br><br><strong>Offline 2-4 Players </strong>- Take the game offline to the full extent. Play with your friends on the couch with up to 4 controllers. (2 Players can use the Keyboard if needed. Though, not the most comfortable experience.)<br><br><strong>Online 1-2 Split-Screen</strong> - Play with up to 3 friends, 1 can even be on the same computer as you with online split-screen. While on split-screen, player 2 will still get full customizing options.<br><br><strong>Constant Updates</strong> - I plan on updating the game for awhile. Adding Puzzles, Game Modes, Music, Ect. (And of course, tweaking the online experience and removing any bugs.)<br><br><strong>Quick Matching</strong> - Don't have a lot of time? The average game length is 3 minutes. Too Short? Bump it up from 10 puzzles to 25, or 50, or even 100.",
