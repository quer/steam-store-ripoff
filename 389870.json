It’s turn based, where you have an area you can move about in and from there a smaller area you can attack in, this gets bigger/smaller for some skills and is fairly similar to a tactical RPG system, but in 3D and it feels a lot less restricted… The game performs really well too, I’m fairly below the minimum spec, but on the lowest setting I have next to no slowdown in game… Overall, it’s a nice little title.”<br>7/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.otakugamers.uk/2015/10/26/mugen-souls-steam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Otaku Gamers UK</a><br><br>“Mugen Souls is a fun, fast-paced RPG with a goofy sense of humor and a million interlocking gameplay systems, and both makes fun of and feels like a throwback to a more traditional style of RPG”<br>3.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2012/10/09/review-mugen-souls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hardcoregamer (PS3 review)</a><br>",
