Although we finished on time, we broke one of the game jam rules and decided it would not be fair to submit since we did not comply with the criteria.<br><br>I had no idea how to approach this kind of game where you can combine words and do random things that are ridiculous. However, I knew I wanted to compose something thematic and light. Fancy Fish Games decided they wanted to go with an Orchestral sound that exhibits a fun, quirky, and ADventurous (like that pun?) mood for the player to enjoy as they fill in the blanks and solve the puzzle on this point and click game.<br><br>Writing for random words and objects was very challenging but I focused on theme and the environment. I imagined that I was child and I was personifying each character. I asked myself, what were their quarrels, wants, needs and overall resolutions?  I woke up every morning before work and composed a little bit for every track until I felt I captured the essence and environment.  Thus, the Adventure Lib Original Soundtrack was born. <br>I hope you enjoy the game and the soundtrack and thank you so much for your support.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tracks Included:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Throne Room (02:12 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Outside Castle Walls (03:25 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>The Dungeon Below (02:30 mp3 128kbps)<br></li><li>Town Square (02:18 mp3 128kbps)</li></ul><br>Music Composed, Arranged and Produced by Chase Bethea : <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://chasebethea.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://chasebethea.com/</a><br><br>Mastered by Ken Jacobsen @ Ken Jacobsen Music : <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.kenjacobsenmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.kenjacobsenmusic.com/</a><br><br>Album Art by Michael Muranaka @ <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://muraknockout.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://muraknockout.com/</a>",
