Their AI can be described as highly sophisticated, funny, stupid, and other things. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor hardcore tennis fans, we made the best physics system that we could, and tennis pros have confirmed that it is indeed a pretty good simulation, but without all the hassles of real life, such as running after the balls or not shooting at other people. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor people who enjoy playing in their own rhythm and not following rules, the game has a perfect mix of funky sandboxy upgrades such as: #lightsaber, #violins, #selfies, #bow and #arrows for that #archery mood, #ponycorn to let you move around on horseback (stick), and #hearts to break (to get more upgrades). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe now support the HTC Racket tracker peripheral! Start the game with it activated and you can play two-handed (or dual-wield rackets) for an intense workout - the Ball People will take care of your balls, you just have to spank them!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInstructions<br />\r\nYou use the triggers to spawn the ball(s) and racket. Double-click on racket trigger to lock it. You can change controller hands on the small button above the touchpad. Knock #BallPeople off the court and take their hearts to enter #HeartAttack mode (time-limited upgrades).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n#SelfieStick is on ball controller's grips and you can record a GIF and tweet it out via the touchpad - log on to your Twitter profile via the computer screen when you start the game. Double-click grips to lock it in your hand. SAFETY IS KING: Controllers can fly, SO WEAR WRIST STRAPS! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor cheats, use google! We &lt;3 cheats ;)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA few cheats on the house (on keyboard):<br />\r\n- B: for High Balls serve mode <br />\r\n- E: for Enio ball (experimental - for higher visibility)<br />\r\n- K: for Kids mode (don't cheat, if you're an adult...by age) <br />\r\n- S: deactivate the #SelfieStick <br />\r\n- M: turn off Music <br />\r\n- Arrow keys: rotate play space <br />\r\n- HAHAHA: Laugh at your friends for extra hearts!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUs VRUnicorns are hardcore jammers and we're constantly jamming on new and fun features for #SelfieTennis.
