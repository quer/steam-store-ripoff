But I have never played anything like Hearts of Iron 4”<br>8.8/10 – <a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/hearts-of-iron-4-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a><br><br>“For now, after many dozens of hours, I'm taking a break from Hearts of Iron 4. Not because I'm sick of it; quite the contrary, in fact. What I need to do is some serious reading, some careful planning on what my vision for the United States should be in 1936.
