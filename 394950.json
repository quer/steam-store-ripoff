Are you smart enough to outwit a giant snowman? How about a half-witted ogre? Along the way, you'll meet a host of colorful characters, from Stumpi the treasure-hungry dwarf in the Fortress Underground to the bossy Mr Chow in the Mystical Pagoda. They will all have plenty of advice - some of it might even be helpful!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will discover hidden paths with a magical lantern and create your own with a well-placed bomb or two. In one moment you'll be dodging between boiling lava and Fire Golems, and in the next sliding perilously over sheets of ice – just be sure not to fall to your doom into the bottomless abyss. You will need to transform into a troll to move heavy objects, a bat to fly across deep chasms, and a frog to squeeze through tiny holes. But how will you avoid the deadly gaze of the Eye-Spy that can turn you to stone in a blink? Drink a handy potion to shrink to a fraction of your size or perhaps sneak past by possessing a nearby ghost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour options are only limited by your genius.",
