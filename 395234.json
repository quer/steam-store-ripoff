Though they prefer to use vehicles they are still HELLDIVERS and very formidable troops on foot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Pilot Pack contains:</h2>• The Pilot Uniform (Helmet, Armor, and Cape)<br>• AC-5 Arc Shotgun: A further development of the Arc technology, the AC-5 fires a wide, short range cone and damages everything covered by the static discharge. The charge up is much faster than the original Arc Thrower but the discharge is not quite as powerful.<br>• EXO-48 'Obsidian': A powerful exosuit with two double autocannons. The firepower contained in this walking monstrosity annihilates light and medium infantry, and the two magazines allows for both maximum firepower or conserving ammunition. The only downside to this mech is its distinct lack of anti-tank capabilities.",
