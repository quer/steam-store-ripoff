But what if one of the player’s goals in such a game was also to decrypt a secret language, where only then they could really understand what was going on? This is the premise of Missing Translation, a puzzle adventure game made by the Spanish studio AlPixel Games.”<br><a href=\"http://indiegamemag.com/unravel-a-new-language-in-missing-translation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Indie Game Magazine</a><br><br>“Missing Translation plans to teach its own language that’s far simpler, a visual language based on drawing lines across a nine-node grid. That’s not the main focus of the game – it’s a puzzler at heart – but if we want to, hey, we’ll get to converse with the locals in our strange new home.”<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/11/28/missing-translation-puzzle-game/#more-253221\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br>",
