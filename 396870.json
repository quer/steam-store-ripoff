            "reviews": "“Catyph is the sequel to ASA: A Space Adventure, and is once again mostly the work of one man, Simon Mesnard, who is the game’s primary designer, artist, writer, animator and programmer. I’ve played ASA, and as solid as that debut adventure was, I found many improvements this time around. The environments are larger and animation now brings them to life. Navigation is smoother and the voice-overs are more engaging, particularly those of Germinal and Lantier. [...] It took me almost 35 hours to finish this game, and by the time the credits launched, I really did feel as though I had been on a space odyssey.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/30652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Adventure Gamers</a><br><br>“If you’ve never played any entries in this series and are wondering if it’s for you, look no further than its inspiration. Do you like first person explorative games such as Myst? If so, it’s for you. If not, I can’t recommend it, as this isn’t some sort of fusion game with another genre. What’s in store for those of you that enjoy the genre though, you’ve got a lot to look forward to in your exploration.”<br>&quot;Buy&quot; – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.fistfullofpotions.com/reviews/catyph-the-kunci-experiment-review-discovering-the-moon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Fist Full Of Potions</a><br><br>“”<br>16/20 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.planete-aventure.net/jeux.php?num_jeu=1873&amp;cat=test#contenu-fiche\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Planète Aventure</a><br>",
