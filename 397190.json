The expansion contains four dynamic historical campaigns set in the 16th and 17th centuries. These chronicle the decline of China's Ming Dynasty and its conquest by the Manchu Qing Dynasty. It also includes the Mandate of Heaven sandbox campaign that enables players to freely choose the opposing forces fighting for supremacy over the Chinese mainland and Mongolian steppes. It also includes four new factions and many new units! <br><br><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/502361/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  id=\"dynamiclink_0\" >http://store.steampowered.com/app/502361/</a></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Sixteenth century East Asia is in turmoil. In Japan, the ruling Shogun family has lost its grip on the country. A civil war is brewing as regional lords actively expand their influence.

These seemingly separate internal conflicts will pave the way for an international war involving the three countries.<br><br><strong>Sengoku Jidai: Shadow of the Shogun is a turn-based tactical and strategic game set during this turbulent time; primarily focusing on the Japanese Warring States period and Japanese Invasion of Korea.
