Manage your troops as they charge head first into battle using weapons, magic and tactics. Hire new units and customize their load-outs with items you have collected over time. Upgrade your items using components left over after battles to make them stronger and give yourself an edge in combat. Can you find the enemy's weak spot and exploit it? Are you able to react accordingly to counter your opponent's strategy?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Modes</strong></h2>In Shadow Heroes, you play through a series of battles that escalate quickly and vary depending on your choices. Based on the game mode, you will have different objectives.<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li><strong>Assault</strong> - Standard game mode, eliminate an objective to win.</li>    <li><strong>Timed Assault</strong> - Eliminate the objective within a time constraint while enemy groups await to ambush you.</li>    <li><strong>Commanders</strong> - Eliminate the enemy commanders who inspire nearby units with their powerful aura abilities.</li>    <li><strong>Onslaught</strong> - Survive against all odds versus an increasingly powerful enemy force.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Single player / Multiplayer Experience</strong></h2>Shadow Heroes has a Skirmish mode that allows players to familiarize themselves with Commanders and Onslaught game modes in a single player experience. In the Commanders game mode, they will fight against an AI commander with up to 5 difficulty settings, which are adjustable inside of the game settings. At the end of every match, you will gain a number of components for a victory, determined by the level of difficulty you have selected. Multiplayer matches of the Commanders mode really put your abilities to the test, as a result, each victory gives you the best rewards.<br><br><br>In Onslaught, players will be defending against a constant assault of enemy forces. Positioning and strategy will be key in your success. The longer your defenses last, the better the rewards you will receive. You will also have access to the powerful defensive cannons of the keep. These cannons have a 5 minute cooldown, but will severely damage incoming forces in a large area. How far will you make it?<br><br>Everything you find, craft and equip goes with you through both your single player as well as multiplayer adventures. If you're struggling with players online, work towards better items in skirmish or campaign and vice versa.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Active / Passive Items</strong></h2>Shadow Heroes has two types of items in it: Active and Passive. Passive items provide bonuses to your unit's stats and in some occasions, abilities that the AI will use automatically. Using passive items is a great way to boost the overall effectiveness of your army without adding to your workload. <br><br><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/398670/extras/GysirisDeathhat_I_80x80.png?t=1479802008\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> <img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/398670/extras/IntensifiedPraise_I_80x80.png?t=1479802008\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> <img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/398670/extras/MaskOfVasburg_I_80x80.png?t=1479802008\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> <img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/398670/extras/OrcDiplomacyTrophy_I_80x80.png?t=1479802008\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> <img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/398670/extras/PhaneksJoy_I_80x80.png?t=1479802008\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> <img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/398670/extras/StrangeQuark_I_80x80.png?t=1479802008\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"> <img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/398670/extras/YuhannasGlare_I_80x80.png?t=1479802008\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><br>Active items on the other hand only provide bonuses when you select the unit with the item and activate it.
