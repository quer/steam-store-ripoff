            "detailed_description": "<h1>Huge Update In The Works!</h1><p>Hello everyone! I just wanted to give all of you a quick heads up about some new content coming to Hoven the Sages Spinel. There is going to be a new window outliner, some new enemies, and the first piece of DLC! Oh, and all DLC will be FREE OF CHARGE and come in the form of updates. HOWEVER, due to the amount of time and effort it take to do this, I will be increasing the price of the game to $4.99. Which I believe to be a good trade. I plan to have the update launched by the 2nd of October. Have a good one!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Welcome to the world of Hoven! Join Bradley and his friends on an adventure that transforms into an epic quest! Traverse dangerous dungeons and battle fearsome foes.

Exceptional music- Hoven's soundtrack, composed by DjEnob, is one of it's main staples. With over 40 different tracks, and themes ranging from ambient to \r\n    just plain silly, there will be a little something for everyone to enjoy!\r\n2. Innovation- Hoven is the FIRST RPG Maker title to be fully compatible with the DualShock 4 controller! Just be sure to plug it up before you launch the game!\r\n3.
