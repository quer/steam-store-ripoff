Scouting around, she mistook Gnaw's tail for a juicy piece of lovely unicorn candy. After cheerfully biting down on the treat, the startled Gnaw led her right back to the Awesomenauts who managed to convince her to stay with a wide variety of exotic treats, lots of petting, and by brushing her manes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Nibbs in Awesomenauts. You need to have Nibbs available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game.",
