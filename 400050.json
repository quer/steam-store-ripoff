While it looks like a traditional thinline ES-style instrument, it’s made from routed solid woods (rather than a laminated top, back and sides with a solid center block) to give sonic solidity, punch, and a tone that’s both big and defined. A mix-and-match set of two classic Gibson bass pickups provides the tonal flexibility that makes this unique bass an excellent choice for rock, jazz, funk, and blues..<br><br><strong>Specifications:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>153 mono samples (154 MB), FLAC format<br></li><li>Resolution: 44.1 kHz, 24-bit<br></li><li>Programs: 6 (two per pickup combination: pick attack keyswitchable to thumb attack, and thumb attack keyswitchable to short decay)<br></li><li>Compatibility: Rapture Pro, Rapture Session<br></li><li>Instrument Page controls: Bass Tone, Treble Tone, 8-String (synthesizes octave above strings), wavetable Suboctave, TouchFilter, Growl (amp-like distortion), Chorus Rate, Chorus Depth, X/Y Pad 1 (LFO depth and frequency), X/Y Pad 2 (8-String and Suboctave distortion)<br></li><li>Special features: Open string up and up/down slides, FX sends for tempo-synched delay and LFO filter</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EB 5-String Bass:</h2> This major update to the original EB 5 pack for Dimension Pro features a smaller memory footprint, faster loading, keyswitched attacks, and takes full advantage of Rapture Pro / Rapture Session’s Instrument page controls. The EB 5-string bass provides eight unique sound combinations from two pickups thanks to Gibson’s Tuned Coil Tap pickup technology, and represents the sweet spot of low end, definition, versatility, and warmth.
