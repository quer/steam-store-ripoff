Play as a tourist having a full-year vacation on the island, on a mysterious invitation. Will it be a fun holiday or will it be a thrilling adventure? What about the romance? You decide!",

Although it’s definitely not your atypical RPG it’s a refreshing game that offers a lot to those who give it an opportunity.  The game incorporates the traditional components of a JRPG in RPGMaker style but it also features critical components of an adventure and romance game as well.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.steamified.com/2016-is-nusakana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Steamified</a><br><br>“Nusakana is incredibly ambitious; it's a lengthy game with a lot of endings and because of the structure (or lack thereof) it'll take a long time to see everything. Despite the different ways to play the game in this updated version, it's still not something I'd call a &quot;crowd-pleaser&quot;. Nusakana is a very niche title, but if you can deal with the slow pace, translation issues and a few odd design choices you'll find an interesting RPG with an unique Indonesian flavour.”<br>3/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jrpg.moe/nusakana-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >JRPG moe</a><br>",
