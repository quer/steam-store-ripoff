Will you find what’s behind the simulacra ?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBerkeley, 1967. Experience the perils of coming down off acid, a post-breakup bout of depression, and the anguish of a dying career: Welcome to the life of Elvin Green, a science fiction writer in deep distress. Get ready for a sensory trip that will derail your sense of reality and replace it with powerful hallucinations. You spend your time and money on drugs and cheap alcohol, and are plagued by insomnia and struggles with blank page syndrome. Vague memories of your wife Thea and your editor Don bleed into each other. Everything you thought was real starts to crumble.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would be so simple to give in to the promises of alternate realities, each one more attractive than the next… Will you let these ever-present voices take control of your mind? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalifornium plunges you into a psychedelic world, leaving you searching for glitches in the matrix.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDarjeeling, Nova Production and ARTE France are proud to present this downright love letter to the world of Philip K.
