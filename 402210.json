After WW1 there were many fighter pilots looking for something to do with their flying skills. Many of them created air shows where they would perform stunts, while others offered paid rides to the public. In 1925, flying mail services became very popular, and the world saw such aircraft as the Curtis Jenny, Ford Tri-motor, and Boeing Model 40. There was some passenger travel, although this did not truly begin developing until the late depression. In 1940 WW2 came along, giving aviation a giant boost. It wasn't until after WW2 that the passenger travel boom began. This game is an explosion of beautiful artwork, which was our top priority in the development of this game, as it is essentially a walk through time, and therefore demanding of &quot;eye candy&quot;. It is much more &quot;game&quot; than earlier versions in it's structural design. There are 60 levels, each with a duration of 5 to 15 minutes, depending on your ability. After a level is unlocked, it can be revisited at any time.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/402210/extras/fromatinygrass.png?t=1447378003\" ><br><br>Although most of AMTM is based within the 20th century, Airport Madness takes you back to the year 1802, with a steampunk theme!
