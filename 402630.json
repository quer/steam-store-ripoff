Night has begun, and you decide to head home. If you can... <br><br>It's a <strong>survival horror 2D adventure</strong>. Make your way through the now abandoned high school, packed full of haunting sights and dangerous traps. The school’s hellish corridors are not all you must contend with. Your fellow classmates and teachers have warped into frightening ghosts, who will stop at nothing to hunt you down.<br>In this unthinkable situation, your choice is clear: figure out what brought you here and escape the nightmare. Unfortunately, it seems that your school and its inhabitants have other intentions.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Can You Survive The Hunt?</h2>Run, hide, and hold your breath! Someone is out there. Of all the horrors lurking in your school, the most frightening and dangerous of them all is psychotic killer stalking the halls.

Use maps, notes, and tips from other characters to navigate your way through the world and figure out how you became trapped in such a bleak place.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive &amp; Escape</h2>Everything is out to get you. Youngho will have to avoid a persistent killer, living vines, and more to survive the school. Unfortunately, health is in short supply, and if you're not careful, you will die. The good news is that save-points provide a welcome breather from the onslaught of things trying to kill you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Korean Horror</h2>The Coma provides a glimpse — albeit a horrific one — into the life of Korea's overworked high school students. We hope you'll enjoy our infusion of Korean culture into the survival horror genre.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Content</h2>As Youngho, you must navigate through the three connected buildings of your high school using the help of NPCs and your own wits.
