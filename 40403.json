This expansion includes a massive amount of new content that bring the galaxy to life in exciting ways.

Befriend the dangerous alien Dyson Sphere by helping it against the AI forces, or sneak around it to avoid incurring its wrath (that thing is moody).  If you see a Devourer Golem, don’t forget to run -- preferably as it pummels your enemies.
