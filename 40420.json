The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features:</h2>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new mechanic. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Two-player co-op and competitive play (both local and networked). <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>A wide selection of both action-oriented or brainteaser-like levels. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Casual-friendly adventure mode, hardcore-focused custom games and vs modes. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>20+ game styles, and dozens of items and special blocks. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Rich, painterly art style and beautiful music. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Players can create and share whole new themes, levels, and adventures. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Options for colorblind players, players averse to lots of light and motion, and older computers. <br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>",

I don't think it's a stretch to say that Tidalis is one of the best puzzle game I've ever played. Simply put, if you like puzzle games (and even if you usually don't), you need to get Tidalis. Right now. Go!&quot;<br><strong><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.outofeight.info/2010/07/tidalis-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >James Allen, Out of Eight PC Game Reviews</a> (8/8 score)</strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>&quot;Overall, this is the most robust and interesting casual game I have seen in some time. There is so much to do and so many ways to play I don't even know that casual actually suits it. Yes the gameplay is casual but this is a highly developed, well-rounded, offering from Arcen Games that puts many games of higher price to shame. It's got numerous ways to play and very successfully takes an old genre, turns it on its head, and shows you just what can be done when you think outside of the box.&quot;<br><strong><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamersdailynews.com/article-2510-Tidalis-Review-PC-Mac.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Christophor Rick, Gamers Daily News</a> (GDN Gold Award, 9/10 Score)</strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>",
