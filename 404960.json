The only thing the three characters have in common is the first person view, which fully immerses the player in every character’s life.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THEMES</h2>The Way of Life DEFINITIVE EDITION tells stories about several serious themes: from euthanasia to the death penalty, from war to love, from bullying to discrimination. Every one of them is tied to the other by the game’s main themes: personal growth and the different ways of perceiving reality.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/404960/extras/GifScenesA.jpg?t=1529325953\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHARACTERS</h2>The player chooses how to face every experience, so every playthrough can be different depending on what decisions the player takes. The characters are extremely different, both visually and control related. The child sees the world in vibrant colors, eager to explore it, while the adult has a narrower, desaturated view except for the things he really cares about.
