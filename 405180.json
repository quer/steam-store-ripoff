You see an old fire escape and scramble up to the roof of an abandoned building; you are safe here. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the patrol cars drive past, you slip into the shadows. The coast is clear, you just got away with it… or did you? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn your way back towards the fire escape, the roof gives out from under you and you plummet into darkness. You are wounded, and only equipped with a dying flashlight. Where are you? You must now escape this building. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA twisted ankle, a busted flashlight, in the middle of one of man's great casualty of progress. <br />\r\nThis is the price you pay for avoiding the police. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt smells of death here; the stench of frustration, success and the festering of old hopes. <br />\r\nA shuffling rises up from the infinite darkness before you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRats? No, too big for rats. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStray dogs? Squatters? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat else? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're not hoping to find out, but you must go forth. Determined, you enter the gaping maw of obsolescence. There must be an exit... Get to the exit. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA heart pounding, anxiety inducing, paranoia paradise; 123 Slaughter Me Street is like no other. With a completely unique set of controls and limited mobility, players must have their wits about them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet to the exit, and do so swiftly.",
