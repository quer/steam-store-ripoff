            "short_description": "Having defeated the Campaigner, Turok throws the Chronocepter into a waiting volcano to destroy it. Unfortunately the blast awakens an even deadlier force - The Primagen. Once again a Turok is tasked with restoring peace to the land and stopping the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world.",

            "reviews": "“Overall this game is a step forward in console gaming, it shows off the true power of the N64 in graphics and gameplay. It is extremely fun to play and the fascination of exploring is tremendous. Acclaim didn't make just a better sequel they made one of the best games of the year. For Turok and action fans you're in for a treat. Expansion pack isn't required to see awesome graphics but it raises resolution to give it a slick more detailed look, which is appreciated.”<br />\r\n100 – GameGenie<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“It's bigger and better in every way, including one of the best multiplayer modes ever made in Frag Tag. The addition of extra mission elements makes it as deep as GoldenEye. First-person action gamers will not be able to live without it.”<br />\r\n92 – Nintendo Power Magazine<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“So, what are you waiting for? Run right out and buy this game! Remember to buy the Expansion Pak--it’s worth it just for this game, and hopefully there will be future N64 games that will take advantage of it. This may be the best N64 game to date, no joke.”<br />\r\n90 – HappyPuppy<br />\r\n",
