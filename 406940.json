The tracks are decomposed into diverging game mode segments. The obstacles, tracks and visual effects are all adjusted to the music and in perfect harmony with each song. Dub Dash has a great soundtrack including music from Bossfight and the DJs of Geometry Dash – to enjoy the full experience the use of headphones is highly recommended. <br><br><strong>UP TO FOUR PLAYER SPLIT-SCREEN MODE</strong><br>Challenge your friends to the ultimate race in this breathtaking split-screen competitive mode for up to four players simultaneously. Who will beat most of the level? Jump in and find out!<br><br><strong>SEVEN ULTRA CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY MECHANICS</strong><br>Spin your crazy wheel in harmony with the song and keep dodging left and right avoiding obstacles at high speed. Fly like a bird, make hard 90° turns and feel the rhythm of the zig-zag trajectory. The objective for each track is clear: Do you rock the funky road of Dub Dash?<br><br><strong>GRAPHICAL FIREWORKS</strong><br>Dub Dash offers impressive colorful graphics and effects with a steady and smooth high framerate. Immerse yourself in a hypnotizing psychedelic experience.<br> <br><strong>SKILL COMES WITH PRACTICE</strong><br>The gameplay of each segment is simple but it´s tough to master the levels. Actually it´s extremely hard, almost impossible – but fortunately there´s the practice mode which gives you a save point after each passage so you won´t need to finish the whole level in one try.
