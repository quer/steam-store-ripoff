If you’re willing to take that on then it makes it more than worthwhile, borrowing from several genres to create something that feels unique - as well as bursting with personality and smart choices.”<br>8.1/10 – <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/11/13/dungeon-of-the-endless-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN</a><br><br>“From its setting to its design and aesthetic, Dungeon of the Endless feels like a game built for me. It’s tough and unforgiving, but it’s also fair. Despite all the deaths I spent climbing through the dungeon’s floors, I slowly mastered the game. That’s a testament to the roguelike genre, and it’s why I like tangling with it so much.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/dungeon-of-the-endless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Revolution</a><br>",
