His goal was to rule the world! However, after an unexpected fight, he was defeated by another magician named Sathenu. Sathenu found Daeron's weapon and broke it into relics and scattered them around Time. Then he created an ancient organization to protect these relics, and two Artifacts for anyone to travel back in time, if the world is in crisis again. The Guardians of Time were the protectors of these relics. Then, thousands of years later into the future, Nrutas, an orphan, realizes his power. So he finds and uses one of these artifacts to travel back to the first relic location, the Medieval Era, within the Kingdom of Atheos!

Remember that there is a small chance that you may not find any treasure aswell!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PvP</h2>Is also a main feature on Lonath Online. This allows you to fight with other players from different classes. This is where you are going to show your real skills! Players that want to fight with each other must be outside the safe zones. Killing other players gains you XP which increases your levels, same as killing monsters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Magic spells</h2>Allows you to use magic spells against other players and monsters.

You can aswell use hotkeys (numbers 0-9) to cast spells, and some spells can only cast by using hotkeys.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Custom hero creation</h2>Allows you to create a custom hero choosing from 3 different classes: <br><strong>Warrior</strong> - you can take this class if you want your highest ability to be Strength. <br><strong>Mage</strong> - you can take this class if you want your highest ability to be Magic. <br><strong>Defender</strong> - you can take this class if you want your highest ability to be Defense.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Horse Riding</h2>Is a really cool feature which allows you to ride horses and other available rideables.

These spells must be targeted by pointing your cursor to your target.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Melee attack</h2>This is a really unique feature we implemented. The feature itself is not really unique, because most of the MMORPGs have this feature, right? But, we made a little tweak, which makes the game more realistic, yet harder. You can use Melee attack by left clicking on your mouse, but if you are too far away from the target, you will miss! This being said, to use Melee attack you must be really close to your target so you can hit them. <br>There is also a cooldown system, after every hit you make, a bar in the bottom of the screen will show with a countdown. After you make a Melee attack against your target, you will have to wait a few seconds, depending on the weapon, to make your next Melee attack.",
