I appreciate the Stanford Ocean Acidification Experience for calling attention to the peril our oceans face and what we must do to protect them.”<br />\r\nU.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“One of the things I appreciate most about the virtual reef they have created is that it represents what I actually saw when I was underwater. We worked hard to make it scientifically accurate. This accuracy is really important when we are using this virtual world to teach about the real world.”<br />\r\nKristy Kroeker - Assistant Professor, Physical and Biological Sciences, Univeristy of California Santa Cruz<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I am thrilled that VR technologies can bring people 'under water' to experience the impacts of ocean acidification. I am so impressed with the realism and accuracy of the VR experience”<br />\r\nFiorenza Micheli - David &amp; Lucile Packard Professor in Marine Sciences, Stanford University<br />\r\n",
