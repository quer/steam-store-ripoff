It's a delightful homage to the games of yesteryear, and it offers an imaginative world that is quite immersive and highly entertaining”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.joshuabarsody.com/2016/11/ginger-beyond-crystal-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Huh?</a><br><br>“Like other indie games this one doesn't shy away from colour and plays alongside the kind of music that puts a spring in your step. Surprising town customisation that makes it feel that little more like your own game. Another bright and cheery game.”<br>71% – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://brutalgamer.com/2016/11/09/ginger-beyond-the-crystal-pc-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Brutal Gamer</a><br><br>“I enjoyed every minute of Ginger: Beyond the Crystal. The level and world design are fantastic. When playing Ginger: Beyond the Crystal it just feels like you are playing one of the good 3D platformers from the 1990s and 2000s. If you don’t really care for platformers or insist on being challenged, Ginger: Beyond the Crystal may not be for you. If you miss the days of the cartoon 3D platformer though, I think you will love Ginger: Beyond the Crystal.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/ginger-beyond-the-crystal-indie-game-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Geeky Hobbies</a><br>",
