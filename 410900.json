The Armoury unlocks Flak guns to clear the skies of enemy projectiles, and EMP rockets to power down enemy tech, both of which can be upgraded to the Shotgun and twin Rocket launcher, respectively. The classic Cannon is now found in the new Munitions Plant, where it is joined by it's little brother, the burst-firing 20mm Cannon.

It's a fun cocktail that puts me in mind of Scorched Earth, or maybe a Scorched Earth that let me build a bunker around my tank. And then three more tanks on my bunker.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/05/forts-is-a-fun-mix-of-rts-and-worms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>“Forts is an exceptional example of how a release can properly integrate many mechanics, from multiple genres, and get it right. The fast-paced challenge of managing multiple tasks before you’re obliterated creates a sense of urgency and an increased heart rate that you wouldn’t normally find from a title that simply leverages one of these mechanics. Buy Forts, and make a solid investment in your game library.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://opnoobs.com/reviews/indie/strategy/forts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Overpowered Noobs</a><br><br>“Forts is a simple, fun game, has a nice sense of humour and is guaranteed to get your brain whirling as you figure out the best way to build your base, defend your weapons while also pelting the enemy with bullets and bombs.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/forts-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameGrin</a><br>",
