Here’s a closer look at what you can do with Quicken WillMaker Plus:<br><br><strong>Your Will</strong><br>The heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues.

For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these.<br><br>New for 2016:  You can now use the Quicken WillMaker Plus to give your attorney-in-fact authority over your digital assets.<br><br><strong>Your Final Arrangements</strong><br>Plan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones.
