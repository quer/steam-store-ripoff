It was designed in the 1970s as a lightweight fighter and in excess of 600 M-2000C aircraft have been built. The M-2000C is a single-engine fighter with a low-set delta wing with no horizontal tail. It has excellent manoeuvrability given its relaxed stability and fly-by-wire flight control system. The M-2000C also includes a multi-mode RDI radar that is capable of tracking and engaging targets at beyond visual ranges. In addition to engaging other aircraft with cannon and missiles, the M-2000C can also engage ground targets with cannon, rockets and bombs.
