What’s more, in order to enhance gaming experience, Driver Booster also supports game-related graphic &amp; audio drivers with performance improved specially for hot games. And game components are also covered to offer necessary game support and get rid of various lock-in issues of game run times. In short, Driver Booster is a driver updater to increase system compatibility, stability and performance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Powerful Database </h2><br>Driver Booster 3 for STEAM adopts online database to update drivers in real time. At present, over 200,000 device drivers are included and the number continues to rise. Rare drivers and newly released drivers like Graphics Driver, Audio Driver, Network Driver, Chipset Driver, Printer Driver, etc can be detected in this beefy database to ensure that your devices match the best drivers. Thus, your hardware performance boosts and your computer reaches its optimal state.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Boost </h2><br>Driver Booster 3 for STEAM collects game-related graphic &amp; audio drivers which are optimized specially for hot games. These driver updates can fix flickering or blurred screen and no sound or sound crackling problems to improve game fluency for better experience.

After you finish what you focused on just now, you can determine whether to continue updating.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Auto Download </h2><br>Driver download is a very tedious and time-consuming task. Driver Booster can automatically detect outdated drivers and download them when your system is idle to save half of the driver update time. Or you can disable this function if you think it's unnecessary.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Missing &amp; Faulty Drivers Detection </h2><br>Driver Booster does not only update outdate drivers but also fix missing &amp; faulty drivers, especially after upgrading your operating system or using your PC for long period time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simple &amp; Safe Update </h2><br>Driver Booster only installs drivers passed WHQL by default to guarantee security of driver resource. And more technology solutions, such as System Restore, Driver Backups, Driver Roll Back and Device Uninstall features, will keep your computer safe to the hilt. Once anything unexpected happens, you can recover the previous good drivers. Moreover, the Feedback window make it easy for you to send anything to the 24/7 technical support team.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Others </h2><br>Driver Booster, of course, does more than above. Functions like program version auto-update, real-time detection of peripheral drivers, scheduled scanning and reminding, UI customization, network proxy support, and more are to be discovered by you.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/412090/extras/table.jpg?t=1477042536\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About License</h2>The license codes of Driver Booster 3 for STEAM are Lifetime/3PC.
