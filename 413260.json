Colonel. \r\n\r\nThat’s what the US army thought of my script. \r\n\r\nI remember the smile on my face. I was an athlete used to hours of extreme exercise, and I thought the military was going to be easy. But after the first day I didn’t smile anymore. I was used to exercises that build you up; In the military all they did was break you down. You work out for days, you get bullied, and you don’t get to stop when you’re tired and pissed off. You just keep going.\r\n\r\nStories of revenge were gladly shared, we held on to anything that made us feel free again. But there was one story that I will never forget. A rebellion so insane that it simply couldn’t be true; this is what I decided to base my short film on. I’m Swedish so my military experience was different, but If the US military doesn’t want to support it I must have done something right. \r\n\r\nThis is my revenge story.\r\n\r\nAdam Stumle\r\nWriter &amp; Director",
