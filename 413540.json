It also powers up sockets.<br></li><li> <strong> Laser: </strong> Rotating lasers that damage characters and activate optical receivers.<br></li><li> <strong> Vortex: </strong> Elevates and hurls enemies around. Powers wind-activated objects.<br></li><li> <strong> Thumper: </strong> Screws itself to the floor and launches characters and physics objects in the air.
