            "reviews": "“The simple yet pithy strategic layer gives battles new weight, new meaning... The new turn-based strategic game works rather well. During the course of a 48 month/turn campaign, there are thought-provoking choices aplenty. Should I invest in another shore battery at Mobile or invest in something more mobile at Mobile? Should I expand my merchant fleet in the hope of generating some quick trade receipts, or focus on constructing the seagoing warships necessary to protect that merchant fleet? Am I ready to attack Key West, or would it be better to concentrate on strengthening the blockade there?”<br><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/08/07/the-flare-path-now-even-harrier/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br><br>“Strategic Layer. That this even exists is one of my favorite things about this game. Totem Games avoided this pitfall by designing a strategic layer to the game from which the tactical battles are generated. This feature adds replayability and puts weight behind the battles you fight.   Tactical Layer. The graphics are surprisingly high-end for a small studio. The ship models are very good quality and have re-skins at different levels of damage, showing pockmarks and scorch marks from cannon hits. Fires, when they occur, look very nice, and the smoke from fires and the powerplants is very well done. Ships list when taking on water. The quality of the water is near immaculate.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.subsim.com/2015/review_ironclads2.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >SubSim</a><br>",
