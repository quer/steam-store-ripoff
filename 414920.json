            "short_description": "Corgi Warlock is a 1-4 player side-scrolling fantasy action game, where one brave Corgi will take on the Skeleton Bunny King's army! Against the power of Narwhals, Fencing Bears, and Crazed Unicorns, it takes more than your average Corgi to survive the King's onslaught... it takes a CORGI WARLOCK.",

Screen-sized rock monsters, vampires, dragons, and more. Corgi Warlock never fails to surprise you with its variety of bad guys.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.co-optimus.com/article/13786/corgi-warlock-has-corgis-co-op-a-giant-spider.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Co-Optimus</a><br><br>“The animations in the game are great. The combination of colorful graphics and precision-based platforming and combat is a nice throwback to the old-school of gaming like Ghost &amp; Goblins and Ghostbusters, where timing and reflexes are essential for making it through the levels.

It is very cartoony, with each character having a lot of little quirks and details (I am particularly enamoured with the goblin mages branch arms, and the cute baby-like Cyclops), and the animations are very smooth and well produced. The game has a very vast and varied cast of characters, which could appear quite jumbled when appearing together, and yet stylistically all fit beautifully.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.hittincrits.com/featured/corgi-warlock-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hittin' Crits</a><br>",
