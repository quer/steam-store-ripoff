            "detailed_description": "PD Howler 10 is a digital painting and visual effects program for Microsoft Windows (best on 7,8,10...)<br><br>Going beyond advanced digital painting,  Howler includes numerous visual effects tools, like compositing, rotoscoping, re-timing with motion estimation, block interpolation to extrapolate un-finished frames from your 3D program, camera stabilization and camera motion removal.  Add motion blur to stop motion, keyframe FX filters on a timeline, scan frames and clean them up, and a lot more. There is also a 3D capability, particularly useful for generating realistic landscapes, mountains and other items defined by an elevation maps.  PD Howler also supports 2-D animation, light-table, lip-syncing, and working on video.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Main Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Paint: Digital painting with many types of brushes, including large custom images, image sequences (animated brushes that can be edited on a timeline), natural media brushes, particle brushes to spray paint grass and shrubberies or animate smoke and fireworks, bristle brushes for realistic oils and acrylics, “Orbicle” brushes with audio controlling their appearance, foliage brushes that grow and let you paint a complete tree in a single brush stroke, with 3D depth and ambient occlusion shading, plus a huge complement of presets.<br></li><li>Animate: Video frame editing and post work for special FX, traditional frame-by-frame animation and working with video on video, time stretching, motion estimated interpolation, batch processing, frame repairing, motion tracking, chromakeying, green screen compositing, rotoscoping, rendering of frames with added 'breathing' motion, exposure sheet for manual syncing against an audio track.  Remove camera motion to simplify rotoscoping and other effects, then re-apply the camera's motion.  There's also a very comprehensive set of filters that work in realtime, most of them animatable either directly or on a timeline.<br></li><li>3D: Capabilities include a 3D Designer for creating 3D terrains from elevation maps, adding erosion and sediments, coloration based on elevation and slope, ambient occlusion and raytraced shadows.  Puppy Ray rendering with global illumination and ray tracing on CPU or accelerated on the GPU, volumetric clouds with the animated Particle Modeler, and various filters for stylized lighting and perspective effects. You can render an animation wherein you fly across your landscape and keyframe its parameters. Exports for .obj format, erosion and elevation maps, texture map, shading maps, 3D mesh and feature maps (grass, rock and snow regions.)<br></li><li>FX: Numerous filters for post work in various categories: Adjustment filters, Coloring, Blur, Photographic filters, Sharpening, Convolution filters, Transformation filters (including 3D transforms,) Video related filters, Cleanup, Artistic filters, Stylize filters, Rendered effect filters, and a collection of Animated filters. There is are also sets of filters that combine the main image with the alternate swap image.  You can have multiple animations stored in memory or on disc in order to have them handy to combine and composite.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Paint features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Natural media, many presets, fully customizable<br></li><li>Full digitazing tablet support, such as Wacom devices<br></li><li>Custom brushes, bristle brushes, particle brushes, foliage brushes, brushes under the influence of force fields<br></li><li>3D orbiting particle brushes (Orbicles)<br></li><li>Dynamic Rules-based Foliage brushes<br></li><li>Animated (multi-frame) custom brushes<br></li><li>Pigment lifting for realistic paint effects<br></li><li>Well over 100 fast full featured filters.
