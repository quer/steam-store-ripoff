            "reviews": "“Engare is an eye-catching game. In Steam's sea of gritty multiplayer shooters, pixelated platformers and cartoonish RPGs, it immediately stands out. Engare is sparse yet richly detailed at the same time, filled with looping lines and delicate curves. It's a game about geometry, art and architecture. Put simply, it's a game about beauty.”<br><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/07/engare-indie-game-iran-mahdi-bahrami-islamic-art-steam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Engadget</a><br><br>“I'm so delighted that the years of wait for Engare, after teases at events like GDC, turned out to feel absolutely magical and unique in the gaming realm. I want to install this game on the hard drive of every self-proclaimed nerd—and every elementary and middle school's computer labs. I want this wild geometrical-shape spirograph experiment to be an edu-tainment rite of passage, just like SimCity and Carmen Sandiego were for me. And maybe above all else, I want the Western world to look in awe at the culturally unique stuff that gaming can create when it's put in the hands of more diverse creators.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/engare-review-spirographs-math-and-islamic-art-blend-for-quite-the-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Ars Technica</a><br><br>“Engare made me grin each time I’d gotten it right. And perhaps more importantly, also when I’d gotten it wrong. Because either way, I’d made a pretty pattern.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/26/engare-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br>",
