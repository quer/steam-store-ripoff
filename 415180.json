Missing for the last couple of years, there have been regular requests to offer it again. This download is the original game from 2009, which should run on most modern systems. It is offered here for the players and modders who requested a clean, legal copy of the original code. <strong><i>NO FURTHER UPDATES ARE PLANNED BY THE DEVELOPERS.</i></strong></p><br><h1>Product Notes</h1><p>The game supports keyboard and mouse on a standard PC screen. Your camera and inventory controls shift from FPS to isometric like many modern RPG’s.<br><br><strong><i>This product is the last public build released several years ago and is offered as is.</i></strong></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>FORT ZOMBIE IS BACK!</strong><br><br>Back by popular demand, the ground-breaking cult classic indie game that kick-started the modern Zombie Survival genre: Fort Zombie.<br><br><i>“We have one chance.
