Your pizza's here!&quot; You announce. No one answers. There's an eerie silence. <br><br>You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you. <br><br>You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house. <br><br>Freely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by.
