Somewhere amid the curious puzzles and the dreamlike neoclassical ruins painted with an art nouveau pallette, Pavilion became about the language of play.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://killscreen.com/articles/pavilion-maze-metaphor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kill Screen</a><br><br>“I would recommend Pavilion to anyone who likes puzzle games that rely on observation or hidden object games. I also recommend it to anyone who is interested in games as art, for the beauty of the environments and the storytelling.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://indiegames.com/2016/09/pavilion.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >IndieGames Weblog</a><br><br>“An indie gaming masterclass in how to do things differently.
