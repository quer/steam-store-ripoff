This does not apply to all sounds in the game, but will affect any sound loud enough to be heard through walls, and be muffled/occluded by obstacles such as buildings or terrain.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">6 new heads:</h2>For a little more variety, we are providing you with 3 new heads for the North Vietnamese, plus 3 for the US Army and Marine Corps. The 3 US heads represent the diverse ethnicity of the US forces of the period, with one being Hispanic, one Native American and one Asian.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">And last, but by no means least, cinematics for the conclusion of a campaign!</h2>After we released the Multiplayer Campaign update, players requested suitable cinematic sequences for the end of a Campaign. You spoke, we listened, we agreed - so here they are!</p><br><h1>Multiplayer Campaign Content Update</h1><p><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/418460/extras/Campaign_600.png?t=1549920799\" ><br>With this update, we are bringing back the much-loved Multiplayer Campaign Mode from previous games, adapted to the Vietnam War.

We hope you enjoy using it!</li></ul><br>And finally, 3 other maps are out of beta, featuring updates driven by feedback from the players:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Operation Forrest - the Territories version of this official map<br></li><li>Firebase Georgina<br></li><li>Border Watch</li></ul></p><br><h1>ARVN Content Update</h1><p><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/418460/extras/ARVN_01_600.png?t=1549920799\" ><br>This update adds the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) as a full playable faction in the game.
