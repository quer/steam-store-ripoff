Try to imagine a game simple in its basics, but demanding from the very first level, where everything might kill you.

To get the letter from one cage to another you have to maneuver the bird between all the obstacles. However, you don’t directly control the main hero. The bird moves at its own pace, as does the camera. The trick is you can only order the bird to teleport from one point to another by clicking on it and dragging to mark its destination. <br><br>Don’t worry about frustrations though (not too much at least), you won’t notice loading screens between the restarts, and the swinging music, as well as the one-more-try syndrome will keep you playing until you complete all of the 60 cleverly designed levels.
