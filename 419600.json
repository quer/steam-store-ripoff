Discover the art of making indie video games.\r\n\r\nEP1 : New Playgrounds (8’09&quot;)\r\nWith its blockbusters that generate billions of dollars, the games industry of today earns more money than cinema. But the video game is far from being just a cash machine. Artisan game designers, keen to offer unexpected experiences that transport us, are continually seeking ways to escape the same old marketing formulas. On consoles, PCs and smartphones, or at festivals, the indie video game has made Europe its new playing field. \r\n\r\nEP2 : Change the Rules (8’51&quot;)\r\nThe indie game is also a committed game. For the past ten years, the collective, Molle Industria, has been thought of as the precursor of a movement that makes the video game an interactive tool with which to denounce the consumerist society, male chauvinism and offshoots of religion. Other designers have followed this path: they offer moral choices to players and push them to think about their actions, rather than just hammering out slogans. But while the committed game has had success in terms of esteem, and sometime commercial success, it is still very difficult to measure the extent of its influence in society.  \r\n\r\nEP3 : Free Experimentation (7’40&quot;)\r\nHow far can a video game go? An experimental artistic vision blurs the frontiers between player and spectator and brings to the video game experiences that are immersive, explosive, contemplative and radical.  \r\n\r\nEP4 : Beyond the Screen (7’21&quot;)\r\nCreative freedom goes beyond software. It includes reinventing the joystick the keyboard, the mouse, and creating new game interfaces with everyday objects. With this return to the physical game, the player comes out of the screen and rediscovers his neighbor.  \r\n\r\nEP5 : Co-creations (7’32&quot;)\r\nBy getting together in collectives or taking part occasionally in game jams, exercises in creating games in a limited time, the indies are federating.
