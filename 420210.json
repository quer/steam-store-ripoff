It’s nothing like a click-and-slash button masher. Button mashing will only get you killed.

Either battling monsters or common warriors, you will be eagerly waiting for your turn to come. You will face countless fearsome mobs and grotesque beasts, hidden deadly traps, powerful demon knights and dragons.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/420210/extras/story1.png?t=1483782270\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY</h2><i>You are a noble man living in a small and peaceful village. <br>One day you return from the forest with some wood and see your village ravaged and left in ruins. Your friends and family dead or taken away. One of the few survivors, was able to tell you what happened in his last moments:Unknown demon forces came and destroyed everything without a reason, taking away the ones you love. <br>There is no other way for you but, go on a quest to save them... <br>As you progress in your path, you realize, that there is something more, something bigger, something terrifying behind this. </i>",
