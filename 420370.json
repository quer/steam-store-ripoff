Shiro is an unbelievably cute, cuddly creature that loves collecting magical fireflies. One day, the magic lantern in which he kept his magnificent little creatures broke, and they all flew away. Shiro was heartbroken. Join Shiro and his friend Seraphin, an expert magician, on an epic adventure to bring all of the Lumies home safe and sound.<br><br>But don’t waste any time!

In the Fire World, you have to tread carefully to keep from burning your little feet. In the Ice World, on the other hand, is it really icy, and you have to avoid slippery surfaces that can send you careening into deep chasms. So be careful! In the magical Dream World, things are very busy, as all of the dreams that people lose eventually wind up here and help regenerate the island.<br><br>Seraphin acts as your wise friend and counselor. If you do not know what to do next, he will help you. <strong>Gravity Island</strong> is a charming, enchanting 2D platform game that is easy for people of all ages to play, but difficult to master.
