Each Colony is further subdivided into areas over which factions will struggle for control. A faction holds control of a Colony when only units of its side are present in the areas of a Colony.

Victory conditions are checked for each side starting on round three and each game ends with victory points being tallied automatically on round eight if no one has won before then. Each round is subdivided into four turns, one for each side, which happen in order determined by a blind draw of the turn marker for each faction.

Each deck has a specific number of movement cards in it and managing them is an important part of the game.<br><br>Each faction has a Truce card which serves not only as a timer for the game but as a powerful Movement card.
