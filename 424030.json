Bug fixes, stability improvements:</strong> This will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game. An alpha is never without its bugs. New content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up.<br><br><strong>2. Performance improvements:</strong> We are well aware of the performance of the alpha is needing to be improved - especially at higher playercounts.

Expanded server moderation tools:</strong> This will allow server administrators more control to manage and configure their server using commands such as: kick,ban,change map, change skirmish area, change weather and time of day.<br><br><strong>4. End game events:</strong> Taken out just before the launch on Early Access, the end game events will be making a comeback in a more fleshed out form, specifically designed to create more memorable end game moments in cases where the question of who were the winners of the match is heavily contested.<br><br><strong>5. Improved melee:</strong> Melee is going to be receiving a much needed overhaul, including the availability of a parry move and animation kill sequences between two players (“kill-moves”) to increase the visual fidelity of close quarter fighting.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/424030/extras/Melee_650.jpg?t=1544535237\" ><br><br><strong>6.

Fleshed out officer order system:</strong> Additional officer commands will be introduced to allow for a greater range of tactical options.<br><br><strong>8. Musicians:</strong> Working in tandem with the officer order system, musicians will have to relay the correct calls to help make sure the orders are received down the line.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/424030/extras/Musicians_650.jpg?t=1544535237\" ><br><br><strong>9. Historical Battles mode:</strong> Besides the quicker Skirmish mode, the largest and main game mode intended for the game, known as Historical Battles, would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough, with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas. This will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of Generals, using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield.<br><br><strong>10. Player controlled artillery:</strong> The many batteries already placed on the battlefields will become player controlled once we introduce an artillery system, where players will have access to some of the most destructive and tide-turning weapons of war.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/424030/extras/Skirmish_7_Maryland_Heights_650.jpg?t=1544535237\" ><br><br><strong>11. Generals:</strong> The chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals. Generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack, helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode, helping to bring some order to the chaos of war.<br><br><strong>12. Cavalry:</strong> Horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units, moving artillery pieces, as well as for the high command and their couriers. The cavalry was still an important branch of the armies of the period considering the changes in technology, acting as reconnaissance and quick response units as understandings for their use developed over the period of the war.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/424030/extras/Cavalry_650.jpg?t=1544535237\" ><br><br><strong>13.
