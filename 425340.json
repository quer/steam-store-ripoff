The freedom to remap any setup as you please. Jump straight into the game without having to worry about finger gymnastics!<br><br><u>Satisfying Scoring</u><br>Batter the bad guys with a missile barrage until they turn neon, then finish them off with your super laser for a massive bonus! But be careful: neon enemies are much more aggressive!<br><br><u>Tough Love</u><br>Space Moth will challenge you, fiercely. But Space Moth also wants to help you improve, so you can overcome those challenges. Your current condition (position, bombs and lives remaining) will be saved at the start of each stage and boss fight. Then if you lose all of your lives, you will be given the option to return to the condition recorded in the most recent save.

For 1CC games, the answer is today. So you won't find any mixed-resolution assets or showy shader effects, just proper pixel art!",
