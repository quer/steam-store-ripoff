However, one of these angels could no longer stand idly by and decided that the time had come to intervene in the realm of mortals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTurning the weapons of the robotic overlords against themselves, this angel became an armored being of high-tech destruction. Now this fusion-powered, nano-enhanced, tungsten-plated angel is feared across the galaxy. In their frightened whispers its adversaries call this mysterious being 'the Steel Seraph'.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving made landfall on Luxor, the Steel Seraph strikes fear in the hearts of all droids, robots, and demonic influences in the region of space dominated by the ones and zeros. Its first destination? The Awesomenauts!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Ix the Interloper in Awesomenauts. You need to have Ix the Interloper available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game. This skin contains a fully customized voice set, and Steel Seraph Ix has unique voicelines when encountering robotic or demonic opponents.",
