High-altitude Special Ops challenges put tactical skills to the test, with players navigating armed drones above a Russian destroyer and evading RPGs from the roof of a helicopter-swarmed hotel. Upping the ante further, <strong>Face Off</strong> firefights pit players head-to-head on a six-lane stretch of desert highway, at an abandoned crossroads near a New York overpass, and near the path of a violent tornado.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Mode</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Special Ops Chaos Mode:</strong> A whole new way to play Call of Duty®, Special Ops Chaos mode delivers the ultimate in arcade mayhem.
