Through manipulation of the earth itself he can summon immovable rocks and then explode them sending shards of stone into nearby enemies.

Assaulting enemy ley-lines and strongholds is where he really shines and while it might be a challenging set of spells to master, the large amount of area-of-effect damaging spells mean that is it possible to jump in and immediately make an impact on the battle.<br><strong><br>Unique Passive Spell:</strong> Earthen Mantle – Damage resistance is increased base on the current amount of mana the wizard has available. 100 mana = 40% resistance, 66 mana = 25% resistance, 33 mana = 15% resistance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Starting Spells:</h2><strong>Primary:</strong> Burst - Fling 5 small projectiles which each deal 6 - 8 damage and start in a cluster but then spread out over time.<br><strong>Secondary: </strong>Boulder - Throw a heavy physics projectile that has a short cooldown and does 30 - 32 AOE damage in a medium area.<br><strong>Utility:</strong> Erupt - Summon a barrier of rocks which does 20 - 25 damage to any enemies hit and lasts for 7s. The caster must have their feet on the ground to use this spell. <br><strong>Ultimate: </strong>Lodestone - Teleports player up into the air. Player becomes invulnerable after teleport, and can aim beneath themselves. After 3 seconds the player crashes back to the ground at their aimed location and deals 30 - 50 AoE damage.",
