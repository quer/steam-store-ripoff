Her use of combos can deal devastating damage as well as provide regeneration making her a true force to be reckoned with. Yi-Lin, the Jade Sentinel has awoken to defend Centre once more against the hordes of orcs, soldiers, and her old enemies – the Wu Xing Dynasty.Learn more about Yi-Lin in the <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://orcsmustdie.com/#!/en/news/designingyilin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Designing Yi-Lin</a> blog.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Faction: The Wu Xing, Masters of the Five Elements</h2>The Wu Xing are masters of the five elements. Deadly and resilient they make dangerous foes!<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Wu Xing Soldiers: </strong>These soldiers come in four forms: light, medium, heavy, and ranged.  All of the soldiers have magic armor, making physical damage optimal in defeating them.</li><li><strong>Terracotta Giant: </strong>These slow-moving stone giants do not attack players.  Instead, they perform a steady march to the rift, slowing any player that gets too close.</li><li><strong>Red Panda:</strong> Despite being called the Red Panda, these minions are actually blue!  Be careful, these minions cast a powerful speed buff on allied minions.</li><li><strong>Water Dragon: </strong>This hunter minion focuses on players.  Unlike other Hunter minions, this minion has a splash attack, damaging all players within a cone in front of him.</li><li><strong>Elemental Mages:</strong> These mages throw bouncing orbs of elemental energy.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Maps: Three Brand New Maps</h2><strong>Water Garden - Survival (Apprentice and Master)</strong><br>The water gardens of the White Tiger Empire appear to be closest to the first attacks by the Wu Xing Dynasty.  Defend three breaches to the best of your ability without too much help from wall traps.<br><br><strong>Castle Gates - Survival (Master and Rift Lord) and Endless</strong><br>Breaching the Castle Gates is a solid strategy for the Wu Xing Dynasty.  Once inside, defending this open map will be a challenge.  Funneling the front gates to one side is imperative.<br><br><strong>Midnight Market - Survival (Warmage and Rift Lord) and Sabotage</strong><br>These marketplaces of the White Tiger Empire are popular night spots.  This seems to be exactly why the Wu Xing Dynasty has chosen to attack them so aggressively.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Feature: Weekly Challenge Matchmaking</h2>The community has requested this feature for quite a while.
