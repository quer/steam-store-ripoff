Fritz, probably the world’s most popular chess program (think back to FRITZ’s unforgettable victories against Kasparov, Kramnik &amp; Co) offers just that for beginners and tournament players alike: it plays at the highest level, offers training features for every stage of the game and comes with access to <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://playchess.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >playchess.com</a>. It also includes management and analysis options for your own games, as well as a database with 2 million games.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/427480/extras/Fritz15StartEn.jpg?t=1456131657\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Fritz, new friend</h2>The completely reworked “friend” mode makes Fritz 15 the ideal training partner. During the course of a game, Fritz is able to constantly tailor its level to your playing strength and how much time you are using. The program can give you a sign when a tactical opportunity presents itself or point out typical mistakes to help you improve. Another exciting element is the new evaluation function that analyzes your playing strength throughout the game. Where are your strengths – where are your weaknesses? The opening? Middlegame? Or perhaps the endgame? Fritz 15 gives you an ELO rating for all three phases!

You can, of course, also try to find the way to win yourself using the handy exercise function – an approach certain to boost your own conversion technique and playchess ELO!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New author, new engine</h2>Vasik Rajlich is new to the Fritz team. The American shook up the world of computer chess just a few years ago, reaching the top with his program, “Rybka”.
