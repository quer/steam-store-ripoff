A mysterious masked figure shows up one night and steals six holy idols from the local shrine. The self-proclaimed “Archduke of Arges” tenders a hefty reward for their return, and our “brave” duo jumps at the chance to go find them – Pokkle for the glory, and Pipiro strictly for the cash moneys.<br><br>Their journey will take them to every last nook and cranny across the land and lead to confrontations with a wide variety of friends and foes, each more ludicrous than the last, as a sinister plot to revive an ancient “Demon Lord” unfolds and 500 years’ worth of history comes into focus. Can two 14-year-olds with limited abilities and almost no social skills truly save the day? Or is Arges just pretty much screwed?<br><br>Released in Japan simply as <i>Zwei!!</i>, <i>Zwei: The Arges Adventure</i> is the direct predecessor to the previously released Nihon Falcom action RPG <i>Zwei: The Ilvard Insurrection</i>, from the creators of the popular <i>Ys</i> and <i>The Legend of Heroes</i> franchises.<br><br>Boasting a completely standalone story set on a mysterious “low fantasy” island floating amongst the clouds, <i>Zwei: The Arges Adventure</i> plays out as a classically styled action-oriented 2D dungeon crawler with oodles of optional content and unlockables, player-defined challenge through a unique food-based experience system, and a pervading tongue-in-cheek humor style that helps set it apart from other entries in the genre. Although released on several different platforms in Japan over the years, this is the first time it’s ever been officially released in English, and is the most feature-complete version of the game to date.<br><br>So what are you waiting for?

If that’s not enough, why not try for one of the myriad new achievements, seek out one of the newly illustrated character bromides, or switch out the regular soundtrack for its 2008 arranged version?
