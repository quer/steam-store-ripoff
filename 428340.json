The Hexels grid allows artists to create complex vector designs with the stroke of a brush. It is a new kind of workflow that's intuitive and easy to pick up by a beginner, and a versatile tool in the hands of a pro.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pixelate</h2><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/428340/extras/02_pixelate.jpg?t=1516215970\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br>The grid-based canvas in Hexels is a natural fit for the forward-thinking pixel artist. Make full use of the same great drawing tools. Keep track of colors and gradients with the palette. Set your canvas in motion with the animation timeline.

Hexels lets you combine layers of vector and pixel art on the same canvas. Complement angular Hexel art with soft, sweeping brushwork. Carve pixel-perfect trim into isometric art. Block out whole cities in vector form, then dive in for the details.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rasterize</h2><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/428340/extras/05_rasterize.jpg?t=1516215970\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br>Hexels gives you full control over the vector-to-pixel rendering process. Advanced rasterization tools provide vector alignment, pixel-perfect isometric art, pixel scaling, and antialiasing at any export resolution. And because Hexels renders everything on the GPU, you'll see a pixel-perfect preview on the canvas as you paint.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Animate</h2><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/428340/extras/06_animate.jpg?t=1516215970\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br>Build a world and bring it to life with the Hexels animation timeline. Breathe subtle motion into a still image with post effects and motion curves. Send shapes and colors twirling with layer transforms.

Paint tessellating patterns on an endless canvas. Explore advanced grid types like Voronoi. Draft your own grids with a powerful custom grid designer.
