The Anteans, Sclavenians and Venedians may be used in Single or Multiplayer Campaign modes and Custom and Multiplayer battles. <br><br>A hardy and mobile people, The Slavs range far and wide across the blasted Steppe to recolonise and bring new life to abandoned earth. When conflict occurs, they release withering hails of poison arrows on their foes. Whether through diplomacy or conflict, they offer the perfect counter to the Hunnic threat, and introduce a number of unique ways to play Total War: ATTILA in both Campaign and Battle.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/428730/extras/SlavesProdPageLeaders.png?t=1540814283\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New buildings and victory conditions </h2><br>Victory for the Slavic Nations requires the player to build Wonders from the new Legendary building chain. The scale of the victory (minor/regular/divine) and type of victory (military/cultural) depends upon the Wonder built, and players can continue to build different Wonders to achieve greater scales of victory.<br><br>These Wonders, while very expensive to build and maintain, confer increasingly powerful provincial and faction-wide bonuses, and unlock powerful new battle abilities for Slavic units.<br><br>The new City Religion building chain offers temples with numerous religious and civic bonuses, and unlocks the Last Stand battle ability for all Slavic units in the province.<br><br>The new Town Religion building chain offers temples which improve growth and fertility within the province. Combined with their cultural immunity to snow attrition, this enables Slavic nations to thrive more effectively as the climate cools.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/428730/extras/SlavesProdPageBuildings.png?t=1540814283\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Slavic Cultural Traits </h2><br>All factions in the Slavic cultural group benefit from the Hardy Warriors trait, which enables them to swiftly recolonise razed provinces. Hardy Warriors confers the following bonuses:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Immunity from snow attrition<br></li><li>Zero colonisation cost <br></li><li>50% discount for all main settlement buildings.</li></ul><br>In addition, the new Zadruga building chain helps the Slavic nations to kickstart their economies in newly colonised regions. The chain offers a large base income at tier 1, and generates increased wealth from adjacent owned provinces. In brief, the Slavic nations can very quickly establish fresh colonies at no cost, and begin profiting from them immediately.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/428730/extras/SlavesProdPageAncillaries.png?t=1540814283\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Poison arrows</h2><br>A unique new ammunition type available only to Slavic factions, poison arrows are the deadliest arrow type in the game.

Ironically, they were saved from Gothic subjugation by the advancing Huns, who forced the Goths westward before they were able to establish total dominance over the Slavs. The dawning of the 5th century AD promises nothing but further chaos; the Huns continue to maraud whilst the Roman Empire braces against them, desperately hoping to hold back the tide any way they can. Amidst this, the Anteans stand firm, determined to prove themselves strong, to emerge a unified Slavic power!<br><br>With a starting position adjacent to the Huns, the Roxolanians and the Quadians, Antean campaigns offer a significant challenge from the word go.

Although considered a guiding light in the gloom of the upcoming 5th century AD, the path ahead will not be easy - Huns, Romans and barbarians all encroach on Venedian territory. Yet if they can hold their nerve, and never cower to the mighty or the desperate, they may rise to inherit the world beyond!<br><br>Combining major farming bonuses with the Slavic Nations cultural trait, the Venedians excel at colonising and building their economy around algriculture.
