            "detailed_description": "With power over life and death a Nature wizard is vital for a successful team composition. She is Grimoire’s primary healing class but like all classes in Grimoire she can also do solid damage. Through a mix of directed healing, targeted Area-of-Effect healing, and self-centered Area-of-Effect healing she can easily turn a battle alone. Or if taking life is more your style she can be customized with a variety of deadly damage focused spells like summoning ancient wisps which when triggered by a nearby enemy will strike out at whoever disturbed their slumber. <br><br>Many of her spells can also be used on both enemies and allies alike, by changing the frequency she can either heal a damaged friend or tear apart a weakened foe. Her passive spell is very unique in that she gets a second chance at life - whenever the mage’s life reaches zero she transforms into a rabbit, if she then survives for 10 seconds she will transform back into a mage.<br><br><strong>Unique Passive Spell:</strong> Rebirth – When you normally would die, instead you will transform yourself into a critter. As a critter you cannot attack, you have a small amount of heal and your movement speed is increased. If you are not killed within ten seconds you revert to mage form with 50% health and mana. This passive has a 60 second cooldown that does not start until you are back in mage form.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Starting Spells</h2><strong>Primary:</strong> Thorns - Launch small thorns which are attracted to any nearby enemies dealing 4 - 6 damage.<br><strong>Secondary:</strong> Anima Blossom - Conjure a blossom of anima that deals 25 - 30 damage to enemies and heals allies in a medium radius on impact. If it fails to hit any players a blossom is left behind for 5s which heals allies for 25. This spell can be charged for 1s to increase its strength and speed.<br><strong>Utility:</strong> Wisp - Summon a slow moving wisp that deals 16 - 24 damage in a large area on impact. The wisp gains strength the longer it is alive. This spell can be triggered again to direct it to the targeted location.<br><strong>Ultimate:</strong> Tree of Life - Grow a massive tree at the targeted location that grows for 2s and then rapidly heals nearby allies for 15 every second and lasts 15s.",
