Away from familiar tunnels and dank caves, Axe often gets lost on the surface world, but doesn't like to admit it.

Bow did not want to be a babysitter in the bushes for the rest of her life, so she ran away from home when she was sixty (which is like sixteen in human years) to train as an ninja so that she could one day return home a glorious hero and bring glory to short elves everywhere. To this day, she still has not found a Ninja Sensei to teach her the proper art of Nenjootsoo, the elven translation of ninjutsu.
