Your flaming longsword cuts five heads in each swipe (no more, no less), which will kill a five-headed hydra, but a larger one will regrow two heads after each swipe. Your storm scythe cuts exactly seven heads, but it makes ten heads grow back if the hydra is not dead. Is it possible to kill the hydra? What if you also had a silver dagger, which cuts just one head, but makes five heads grow back?<br><br>Solution: <span class=\"bb_spoiler\">It is impossible without the silver dagger (the number of heads always stays divisible by 3), but possible with the silver dagger, for example: 9 -&gt; longsword -&gt; 6 -&gt; longsword -&gt; 3 -&gt; dagger -&gt; 7 -&gt; scythe -&gt; 0.</span><br><br>If you liked this puzzle, and you also like dungeon crawling, Hydra Slayer is for you!<br><br><strong>Hydra Slayer</strong> is a roguelike (randomly generated dungeon crawler), with unique combat mechanics based on the puzzle above. It is challenging both at a short term tactical level (each hydra is a unique challenge, bumping into it with your weapon almost never works), and at a long term strategy level (you have to build a set of weapons which slays hydras effectively).
