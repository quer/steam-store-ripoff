Create stunning details, textures, and visual effects by painting in 3D directly onto your game assets in a way that flows naturally.<br><br>Reused / Customized Brushes<br><br>Are you a long-time Photoshop user who’s already built a stable of unique brush tools you can’t live without? You can import your favorite brushes right into MARI indie or create your own customized brush tools with our brush engine. Also, MARI’s special “healing” and “slurp” brush tools add painless seam removal and smear/texture dragging to the mix.<br><br>Advanced Layering<br><br>Greater speed and efficiency are within your grasp. MARI indie 3.0's layer-based workflow lets you paint faster with greater control. Real-time adjustments, GPU-accelerated procedural layers, and advanced masking make it easier to focus on nailing the look you want. The powerful blend of both procedural updates and painted detail in the same toolkit will make your work so much easier.<br><br>Physically-based shading<br><br>Boost your realism to the max! MARI indie 3.0’s physically-based shading system simulates real-world materials, allowing them to react more naturally under different lighting situations. It’s a real game-changer. Paint and texture as you always have been, and MARI indie will calculate shading and lighting in scene linear, simulating the real-time workflow of your game engine.<br><br>Environmental lighting<br><br>When paired with physically based shaders, MARI indie 3.0 s environmental lighting engine will save you time generating a closer near-final look before you button everything up for export to your game engine. With proper lighting situations that match your engine environment, you’ll be able to texture and paint more accurately to achieve the desired end result faster.<br><br>Interactive Preview<br><br>Need to create normal maps from bump maps on-the-fly? No sweat! MARI indie 3.0’s interactive preview is a major time-saver that simplifies the process of generating and manipulating textures. Dynamic lighting and shadow support also let you cast real-time shadows on your 3D game assets from multiple directions.<br><br>Geometry Handling<br><br>Exercising quick, fine-tuned control over multifaceted surfaces across animated assets is a no-hassle affair with MARI indie 3.0’s advanced geometry handling, which tackles animated geometry and textures with ease. You can also easily isolate, select, mask, and hide geometry per patch and face, giving you tremendous flexibility and control over the look of your creations.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Differences between MARI indie 3.0 and full MARI</h2></strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Project file (.mra) linked to Steam account / cannot be shared with other users<br></li><li>The UDIM texture patch count is limited to 6 patches per object<br></li><li>The object count is limited to 5 objects<br></li><li>Export texture resolution size limited to 4k and 16-bit color per channel<br></li><li>Allowed export formats: .exr, .psd, .png, .tga, .jpg<br></li><li>Output formats no longer available: .tif, .tiff, .hdr, .dds, and .ptx <br></li><li>Python scripting disabled<br></li><li>Session scripts disabled<br></li><li>Custom shaders not allowed<br></li><li>Advanced colourspace configurations and the loading of custom OCIO config files have been disabled.
