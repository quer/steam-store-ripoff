They both feature realistic 3D models and sounds based on recordings of their real-world counterparts.<br>Components like the gearbox, ticket machines and destination displays are created using custom scripts and animations to make sure they behave as lifelike as possible. Unique amongst the OMSI add-ons so far is the dynamic rain feature which places accumulating rain drops onto the windshield that can actually move.<br><br>At the same time, a modular structure of the busses ensures exceptionally high customisability. The player can choose between different doors, ticket machines and other aspects of the vehicles and even change them on the fly without having to reload the bus.
