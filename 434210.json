Engaging, educational, and easy to use.”<br>4.3/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.bestappsforkids.com/2016/its-spring-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >BestAppsForKids</a><br><br>“For a game that's short and sweet, the aesthetics have to be spot on, and they are - the art design and direction is beautifully done, the narration good and the musical integration is superb.  There's evidently a huge amount of thought and effort gone into this, and if you have young children in the target range, it will be well worth the nominal fee.   IT's a &quot;game&quot; designed for a very specific group, and it does its job extremely well.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.indiegamenews.com/2016/01/review-its-spring-again.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Indie Game News</a><br><br>“Supposedly it’s an educational game “for children ages two and up” but I don’t think children would fully appreciate how wonderful it is when e.g. a rainbow saunters past on tippy-toes. No, this lesson in what the seasons are and what they do to the Earth and to trees and flowers and animals and floweranimals is clearly aimed at non-parents in their thirties looking to brush up on their natural sciences.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/03/its-spring-again-steam/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br>",
