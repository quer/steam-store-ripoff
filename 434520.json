            "detailed_description": "<h1>Update Notes</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simutrans has been updated to version 120.3</h2>Apart from fixing serious bugs (and being overdue for more than half a year at least), it has new features. Most notable it is now very easy to host a server yourself. Simutrans will even tried to connect through a router using UPnP (but not all router have this active). Second big change is customizable fonts, which will be a big help for people with larger displays.</p><br><h1>Update Notes</h1><p>Steam Workshop integration has now been pushed out for the application for Windows and Linux. A windows only content uploader has also been made available as a separate DLC to allow uploading of already produced content. There are plans to make additional tools available at a later date.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Simutrans is an open-source transportation simulation game available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your goal is to establish a successful transport company and build the necessary infrastructure to transport passengers, mail and goods between cities, factories and tourist attractions by land, air and water.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Establish a successful transport company<br></li><li>Transport passengers, mail and goods by land, air and water<br></li><li>Interconnect cities, districts, public buildings, industries and tourist attractions<br></li><li>Control and watch your finances and the traffic of your vehicles and goods<br></li><li>Lots of graphics packages to choose from<br></li><li>Play with people from anywhere in the world in online games</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Choices</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Graphics Packages (Paksets)</strong><br>In Simutrans you have multiple choices from the beginning to the end. Even before starting the game you have lots of graphics packages to choose from, every pakset giving you a different experience and play style.<br></li><li><strong>Vehicles and Cargo</strong><br>The success of your company will depend on good planning, and we give you the tools for it. Simutrans can have buses, trucks, trains, trams, ships, airplanes, monorails, maglevs and any other vehicle that goes through air, land or water. Choose them wisely and transport the immense variety of cargo each pakset has to offer, from passengers and mail to raw materials and consumer products.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic and Intelligent</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Cargo has Destinations</strong><br>Simutrans citizens and products don't simply jump in your vehicles and go to wherever you send them. They actually have individual destinations: people want to check out attractions, go shopping, or visit friends. Products also have their destinations - factories have contracts with each other and they won't sell or buy from anyone else. If you don't give them the possibility to go where they want, they simply won't use your transport company.<br></li><li><strong>Complete the Chain</strong><br>Transporting products not only gives you money, but makes the economy roll. As you transport products between factories, they start producing and selling. Every factory receiving the materials it needs starts producing new goods letting you connect more and more factories across the region.<br></li><li><strong>Influencing Cities</strong><br>Your transportation affects city growth. Every unit of anything you transport will affect the nearby cities making them grow and prosper. Sometimes cities will create new attractions and places of interest, which attract a lot more passengers. Or maybe your service may attract new industries, that give you even more opportunities. But not everything you do leads to good things - as cities grow more cars are on the roads, and you will end up trying to deal with the traffic. What you do shapes the future.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Control and Customize</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Configure All or Nothing</strong><br>Simutrans has a lot of configurations that you can customize. If you're not a customization freak, don't worry, generally with a few options Simutrans will fit your play style. But if you are, you'll enjoy all the options and ways to change the game.<br></li><li><strong>Build Your World</strong><br>When you create a new game, don't expect it to be a fixed world. You can shape the world to suit your needs, build roads, factories, houses, and buildings, raise and lower the terrain, create rivers, lakes, and seas, or beautify the world by planting trees.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How You Play</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong><br>Tired of playing alone? Simutrans lets you play multiplayer. You can join a public server and compete and collaborate with people all around the world. You can also play with your friends creating a private online or LAN server.<br></li><li><strong>Hardcore or Casual?</strong><br>You can challenge yourself in a normal game, trying to make your company successful and rich. Or you can just relax and have some fun playing with no hurry or money, just for your enjoyment and the satisfaction of transporting everything.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cost</h2>This game will be <strong>Free</strong> on Steam.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Languages</h2>Simutrans offers a range of languages, translated on a <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.simutrans-germany.com/translator/script/main.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >volunteer basis</a>.
