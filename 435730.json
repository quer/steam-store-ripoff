Their stories are told through a series of interactive vignettes, with different mechanics designed specifically to convey their stories in a relatable and emotionally powerful way. In these vignettes you get to step into their shoes, experience a part of their emotional turmoil, and understand how they relate to the important people in their lives.<br><br></li><li>Text-Based Experimentation: In games, text is often something you want to skip in order to get to the “good parts.” In a•part•ment, we want to make text the “good part” by using it in unique and interesting ways. <strong>Text and reading are central to the game. </strong><br><br><strong>a•part•ment is a short game!</strong> A playthrough of a•part•ment runs about the length of a movie (2-2.5 hours, shorter if you hustle).</li></ul>",
