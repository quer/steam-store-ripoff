Coral Complex mixes open areas and a myriad of hiding opportunities. <br />\r\nRUST PALACE:  Set within Afghanistan, the Rust Palace is a large multi-level building. The skeletal nature of the decrepit ruin means that cover is scarce, and the internal areas are rich in dusty rooms and high-up sniping positions.<br />\r\nAZURE MOUNTAIN:  An outdoor plain under Africa’s baking sky. A small cluster of buildings offers scant cover, with only derelict walls and occasional scrubland surrounding the massive rock known locally as the Cradle of Spirits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQuiet, a buddy character within METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN. <br />\r\nA legendary sniper who can fire a rifle with excellent accuracy, Quiet’s movement speed is extremely fast and allows unique jumping abilities over high steps where normally a player would need to climb a ladder.
