This short ranged melee blade will hack and prune anyone dumb enough to get too close up and personal. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPistol <br />\r\nYou spawn with it. The long range and moderate firing rate will allow you to pick off enemies at both medium and long distances, providing they don't overtake you with heavier firepower.

Good for crowd control. The low damage is heavily compensated by the large area of effect. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrossbow <br />\r\nPrimary fire shoots deadly bolts at high speed. Secondary fire also consumes electricity ammo but allows higher range and damage by using electrified arrows.",
