It features minimalistic, intuitive controls and great depth of unit interaction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBiologists, machines and programmers have been modelling biological systems for many years. We think that it’s about time a video-game got in on the act! This is our unique premise for Soup. We believe that battling agents, with limited interaction types, creates an experience that is bursting with colourful action, yet deceptively strategic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have endeavoured to combine two well-known game mechanics: the strategic building and commanding of units coupled with good old competitive battling! Player control input is purposefully limited but extremely tactical. You will need to keep a close eye on the evolving battlefield and make split-second decisions on which units to employ. These decisions can be the difference between triumphant victory and swift defeat. We have already amassed a community of fans who love sharing their strategies and techniques with us. In short, Soup is easy to pick-up-and-play but difficult to master.",
