The most interesting aspect of this title is its total reliance on audio, and zero use of visual art. The game features full 3D environments, outlined in details through directional audio and cues, and even features a surprisingly challenging combat system. It's a game full of twists, throwing in numerous styles of gameplay from stealth, horse-riding, combat, and even careful navigation of treacherous terrain. Needless to say it's full of surprises that you might not expect to be possible to develop in a game without visual direction.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.nextpowerup.com/articles/a-blind-legend-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Next Power Up</a><br><br>“”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.journaldugamer.com/2015/10/06/a-blind-legend-mobile-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Journal du gamer</a><br>",
