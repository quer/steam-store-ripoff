The antagonist is Bob's Boss, the creator of the gravity suit, and he tries to prevent Bob from leaving the building with it. The level structure is based on 3 Acts, each containing 3 levels respectively. Players will attempt to reach the end of the levels, while avoiding a series of traps and hazards set by the Boss. Upon receiving the gravity suit, players may control their gravity to maneuver across various sections of the level.
