He wakes aboard a desolate ghost ship on the outskirts of an alien solar system, lost and alone, his memories stripped away. His own life is a mystery to him, returning in flashes, and the only sensation of familiarity comes from this alien place. Its secrets feel like words on the tip of his tongue and its presence feels like home. But home was a forgotten, far away place<br><br>His youth returns first, visions of a life marked by poverty in the shadow of a world ruled by a mega corporation and its spectacles of science. Its crowning achievement was an interstellar vessel, the Holocene, a global initiative coated in promises of prosperity, but driven by secretive motives.<br><br>This vessel that carried him, this ship that called itself the Holocene II, it was the apparent successor to the ship of his boyhood wonderment. But why was here there now? Its crew all dead, its captain a strangely sentient navigation computer, it was Ira’s only hand hold to life.<br><br>On it he ventures into the depths of the Lithic System, a place proving itself to be more than just another star. Its wonders drew the gaze of scientists, tempted the greed of the ruling class, but for Ira it distorts his perception, and gently whispers the promise of hope.<br><br>He follows in the wake of the first crew, the idols of his youth, and finds a path that undid them. What force could swallow the largest craft ever known and outwit its most brilliant minds?<br><br>But this place invites Ira, beckoning from the center of the system, guiding him over the solemn ruins of a once budding research colony.

Allow a creeping tension to build in an immersive world as you explore alien landscapes, relive past events, and watch as the nature of reality becomes porous and untrustworthy.<br><br>Playing through multiple timelines, your choices can have far reaching effects as you interact with and play as a colorful cast of characters, guiding their way through a fateful set of circumstances. Choices you make determine your relationship with other characters, who will be present for certain events in the story, and can even determine the fate of certain individuals. Combining our choice system with our multiple timelines will yield interesting outcomes, as making choices in retrospect can change what Ira will find in the Lithic System. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/438230/extras/Lore_header.png?t=1492471283\" ><br><br>Learn about a rich and deep alternate timeline where knowledge and expansion as a planet took precedent over war and petty differences.
