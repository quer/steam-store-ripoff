You then must assign villagers to these resource buildings in order to get the resources. Tax, building upkeep and food consumption are updated every 10 seconds. Build up your resources and expand your town into new zones, as well as upgrading existing buildings.

If your villagers are at 0% happiness, game over, you have to restart. Another way of failing the game is by having no money and a negative income, because you can no longer buy anything.
