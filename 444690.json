Fight for possesion over control points on the game map. The military is trying to stop the mutant outbreak at any cost, while the mutant's intentions, while not fully known, clearly appear hostile. Unite with other survivors to stop both the military and the mutants before it is too late.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>COOP SURVIVAL</strong></h2>The game allows you to play coop with friends, hosting your own servers you can control who joins your game. Time is essential as the longer you play the larger the outbreak will become as it spawns out three classes of Mutants, each one larger and more deadlier than the last.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Core Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Single-Player and Faction-based Co-op Survival.

The military will order air strikes against the mutants and try to hold key locations such as the town and their own military base, they will call in air supplies that can be intercepted.  The mutants will also try and overrun the map and eventually will also try to conquer your base if they are not stopped. You have your own agenda of survival and both the mutants and military will kill you on sight.
