            "reviews": "“Expeditions: Viking spins an absolutely wonderful tale of exploration and conquest. The setting, the story, the ambiance –my imagination ran wild in ways you’d expect to experience reading a good fantasy novel. Betrayal angered me, new friendships elated me, and changing the balance of power in Britain made me feel equal parts devious and mischievous. Reconstructing my home, making it safe, strong and prosperous made me feel proud of my achievements. Every battle, every camp site and map scrubbed clean of its hidden treasures felt like it played a part in the grand scheme of things. There aren’t a lot of games that can pull something like this off even adequately. Expeditions: Vikings does it masterfully.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/expeditions_viking/review/article-1795.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hooked Gamers</a><br><br>“I’d recommend this game to anyone with a passing interest in tactical RPGs, and anyone who looked at Torment: Tides of Numenera and went, “this is bloody amazing.” Expeditions: Viking doesn’t make it feel good to be bad, but it doesn’t have to. It proves that being responsible is hardly the dullard’s choice when it comes to honouring Odin, and after all, history won’t remember you at all if you don’t live long enough to win.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/05/review-expeditions-viking-pc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/05/review-expeditions-viking-pc.html</a><br>",
