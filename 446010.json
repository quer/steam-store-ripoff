That's also why some well known functions have not been implemented - I simply did not have a better idea how to make it differently :-).<br><br>It's not Early Access, because, with some minor exceptions related to fine tuning and bugs, the game is already fully playable as it is.<br><br>Please check also the game requirements - optimization of the game was not the top priority (with that, I would have to sacrifice some features).<br><br><br><br><br><strong>Storyline</strong><br><br>CitiesCorp means that a corporation is taking over the responsibility – so in fact, there are no majors, just CEOs. Your corporation takes care about housing, jobs, products and its own profits. In return, there are no taxes – neither to the corporation nor to the population. <br><br><br><strong>What Is In? What Can Be Played Today?</strong><br><br>- Map That Is Equivalent to 10km X 10km,<br>- Scale Buildings,<br>- Shape Buildings,<br>- Numerous In-game Building Textures,<br>- Creating building complexes through a simple and effective overlapping system, <br>- Multiple building functionalities (e.g. appartments, offices, shops, factories in one building), <br>- Challenging economy with hundreds of products to be produced and sold, <br>- Flexible street building system, <br>- Street signs and lightning for coping with traffic jams. <br><br><br><br><strong>What Is Not In (yet)?</strong><br><br>- Mainly things that can be already played in other similar games - in case there will be a great idea to do it &quot;differently&quot;, it will be implemented<br><br>    - Public buildings, e.g. police, schools, hospitals etc. <br>    - Landscapes - at the moment it is just a flat land, <br>    - Public transport, e.g. trains, busses etc., <br>    - Curvy roads, <br>    - Tax system – and do not even ask for it.",
