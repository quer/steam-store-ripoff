Inspired by Calvin and Hobbes, Ed Edd &amp; Eddy, and our childhood experiences, Neighborhorde aims to capture those countless hours spent imagining action movie scenarios.

As you progress you'll face a randomly-selected but ever-increasing combination of enemies including goop-tossing Lunch Ladies, magic-blasting Wizards, and axe-wielding Abe Lincolns. They're mean enough on their own, but mix these enemies together and they'll send you running home to Mommy. Survive 3 nights in a row, and you'll have to face your first of many epic boss fights. As you're bashed apart by the onslaught of baddies, you realize the only way to survive is the power of friendship; staying close to your team in the <strong>Friend Zone</strong> is the only way you'll regain your health.<br><br>Since there are 80+ weapons and superpowers, and tons of enemies, no game is the same as the last and you’ll always have a new strategy to try. Blast bottle rockets at evil dodgeballs. Blow a bubble-gum-shield to protect your team. Catch the incoming robots on fire with your hair dryer flamethrower.
