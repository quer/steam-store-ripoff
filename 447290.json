It grabs the genre by the throat and drags it into 2017 in brutal style by adding a deep melee combat system and numerous unique types of kills. Redeemer is the brawler for those who love brawlers and have been waiting for a modern take on the genre!<br><br>Play as Vasily, an elite operative who once worked for one of the biggest Cybernetic Weapons Manufacturers in the world. Officially working in security, you were tasked with infiltration, assassination, extortion and even torture. When eventually the corporation decided to turn you into one of its cyborg soldiers, you manage to narrowly escape to a secluded monastery deep in the snowy mountains. <br><br>For 20 years you tried to find peace and harmony amongst your fellow monks, but you are still too haunted by your murderous past to find either. Now after all of these years the corporation is finally closing-in on your location, and in so doing they have given you one last shot at redemption.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Intense Top Down Action:</strong> Take out enemies using a wide selection of fire arms and melee weapons including combat knives, batons, fire axes, hammers and many more.<br></li><li><strong>Brutal Hand-to-Hand Combat:</strong> Use your mercenary skills to beat down your opponents using a collection of brutal fighting moves, combos, charge- and jump attacks.<br></li><li><strong>Unique Kill System:</strong> Use three different types of kills to mercilessly eliminate enemies. Sneak around levels undetected to silently perform graceful stealth kills, or use the very environment to dispatch your opponents using environmental kills by smashing their skulls, impaling them and setting them ablaze in flames (many more options available). Utilize your combat prowess to beat down your opponents enough to enable you to perform savage execution kills that will have you reaching for the screen capture key. <br></li><li><strong>Parry System:</strong> Defend yourself whilst taking down your enemies by utilizing a well-timed block. Learn the movements and attack patterns of different enemy types to perfect your parry and create a ballet of death for all of those unlucky enough to oppose you.<br></li><li><strong>Disarm-or-Dismember System:</strong> Use a unique combat move to either disarm enemies of their fire arms, or dismember certain enemies at will and use their limbs as melee weapons.<br></li><li><strong>Story Driven Single-Player:</strong> Discover Vasily's haunted past and experience a narrative journey of betrayal and redemption.  <br></li><li><strong>Arena Mode:</strong> Practice and test your fighting skills by battling countless enemies in a horde-like Arena Mode. </li></ul>",
