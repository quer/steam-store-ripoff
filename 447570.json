            "detailed_description": "Regeria Hope is a whimsical courtroom visual novel in the style of an Attorney game with original characters and cases. You play as Regeria, a female lawyer who can use her powers of logic and reason to prove her clients innocent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s not all that straightforward though. Sometimes, you may find compelling reasons for throwing a case, forsaking the very defendant you are sworn to protect. These decisions will affect the outcome of the case and will have a ripple effect on later episodes of the series.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first trial has you defending a husband whose wife has been poisoned during the wedding reception. Currently you have the ability to prepare your witness, and interrupt other characters while they are speaking, but be careful, as you have a time limit to solve the case!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKEY FEATURES: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n5 episodes - Choices made in early episodes affect future cases. Don't like a character? You can throw them under the bus. Just be sure you're ready to watch them hang. <br />\r\nNew 'Witness Prep' Gameplay - Prep your witness to say whatever you want. Have them plead for mercy, or make them look like buffoons in front of the court to throw the case faster.<br />\r\nNew 'Fact Overload' Gameplay - Connect the facts together to bombard witnesses and force them to confess! You only get one shot though, so make it count!<br />\r\nNew 'Investigation' Gameplay - Short investigation sections which will affect the courtroom scenes. Play a board game and move Regeria to where she needs to be in time! <br />\r\nNew 'Convince the Jury' Gameplay - Be mindful of all your actions in court! Needlessly interrupting or repeating the same action over and over will change what the jury thinks of you, and you will need to state your case to the jury at the end of each daily court session.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing Music by Zack Parrish!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing Sprite Art by Maesketch<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing Background Art by Sendo<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVoice Acting by:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRachael Messer (Regeria)<br />\r\nMarissa Lenti (Artemis)<br />\r\nDane Doyle (Judge)<br />\r\nRocky Marks (Pharrell)<br />\r\nDigglyCerides (Hawk)",
