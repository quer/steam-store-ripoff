Old Russian diesel locomotives were at the helm of many services, and naturally, as the prices for Black Gold were set on the incline. Outward of the Crisis, it was decided that many of Deutsche Reichsbahn’s lines were in urgent need of electrification.

It would be found that a locomotive capable of 160 km/h, as 212 001 was, was not what East Germany required at the time, many routes were limited to a maximum of 120 km/h.

This change was supposed to represent the fleet’s Berlin exclusivity, but in hindsight it just put more numbers on the rails.
