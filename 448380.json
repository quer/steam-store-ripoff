The top-down view of a car madly swerving around to escape the cops certainly helped, but after playing a bit – actually a big bit – of Escape: Close Call I found it to be a very engaging, enjoyable and fun game. It’s actually one of the most addictive I’ve played recently. I certainly had a hard time putting it down, always going for one more go.”<br>Positive – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://finalbossfight.co.uk/review/escape-close-call/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Final Boss Fight</a><br><br>“It's like I'm playing Michael Bay - The Game.”<br>Positive – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3XDtkyB_FI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >YouTuber Mr Falcon</a><br><br>“If you guys like simple games with an addictive quality that are just fun as hell for not much money, then get this game now.”<br>96/100 – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWtCgaM1Ipg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >YouTuber Zaxtor99</a><br>",
