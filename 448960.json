In addition to this being a great game, the developer is donating all their proceeds from the game to Game Changer Charity, a wonderful non-profit organization whose mission is to spread hope and love to children staying in hospitals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen we think of video games, our minds go to epic battles, fantasy worlds, crazy races and mind-boggling adventures.
