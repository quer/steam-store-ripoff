The Engage platform is also Dropbox, Google Docs and OneDrive compatible meaning you can share all your files and media inside a virtual environment.  PowerPoints, video files, audio files and spreadsheets have never been easier to share. You can even share YouTube 360 videos and stream your desktop PC.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEngage is a multi-user system allowing up to 40 users into a single private lesson or meeting from any location to experience content in a more enhanced way with our “ Immersive FX “ presenter system. This system allows the host to stream in virtual assets that can be interacted with to make presentations and lessons more fun and intuitive. You can also change the digital environment instantly bringing users on a field trip to exotic locations like our Martian surface environment. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nEngage also allows educators and presenters to record their classes and lessons so they can edit them later and publish them on the platform. We call this system “Projected Presence “. Projected Presence allows the presenter or educator to record themselves as they give a lecture or presentation. Projected Presence records their Voice, their Avatar’s movements, and their projected media. Users can then sit down and watch themselves present and if they are happy with the results they can publish their projected presence for the public to enjoy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nProjected presence can also allow you to be in multiple places at once. If you want to provide live talk in more than one room at the same time your avatar can be beamed into multiple rooms to thousands of people giving the illusion that you attended each room personally to talk directly to the users within. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis early preview release of the Engage platform is just a small part of what is to come as we test out some of our network features and streaming capabilities. We are rapidly developing and updating the system over the next few months and want to hear from educational institutes, digital content creators and businesses wanting take the next big leap in digital media and Engage directly with their clients and students.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease visit www.engagevr.io for additional features and info.",
