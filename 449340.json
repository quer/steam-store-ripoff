In the game -- which takes place in the same world as Woodsy Studio's first release, Serafina's Saga -- you play as Odell Perin, an inexperienced young woman who must navigate political intrigue, romantic confusion, and an ongoing murder mystery while serving as Regent of Darzia. The branching storylines depend on your decisions: forming romantic relationships with other characters, finding Queen Belatrix's killer, and determining the next monarch.
