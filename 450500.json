Alongside how goofy this all looks in action, it also provides a surprisingly compelling bit of gameplay to master.”<br>70 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/11/22/review-ace-of-seafood/280417/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hardcore Gamer</a><br><br>“Ace of Seafood is not a game about what it’s like to be a fish. But it does, in oddly literal ways, imagine what it would be like for a human to be a fish, albeit a marauding and cybernetic one. But perhaps that’s exactly the point. As strange as it sounds, Ace of Seafood, down in its depths, is really about how we see ourselves—as human after all.”<br>60 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://killscreen.com/articles/ace-of-seafood-is-all-too-human/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kill Screen</a><br><br>“Ace of Seafood' Is the Laser Lobster War Game We Didn't Know We Wanted”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnxxmx/ace-of-seafood-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Motherboard</a><br>",
