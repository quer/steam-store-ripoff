That change aside, there’s the same challenge of grappling with the particulars of the game’s physics, the same love of alternating bright colours, and a similar menagerie of deadly pursuing enemies ready to destroy you with a single touch. Luckily, there’s also the same sense of satisfaction to be found in trying, failing and eventually overcoming each of its tricky levels.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/05/17/brute-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br>",
