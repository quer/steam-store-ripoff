Most importantly, it's now fully voiced in English by a talented cast of actors. We've also remastered the soundtrack for a better listening experience, touched up the art for a better viewing experience, and added a Chinese translation for a better Chinese reading experience. The bug fixes are numerous, the improvements are vast, and the full changelog can be found in the announcements section.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/451760/extras/SD_amber_marina_aboutthisgame.png?t=1551120133\" ><br><br>Highway Blossoms is a short yuri kinetic novel set in the American Southwest.
