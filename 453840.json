With nothing left to lose, he takes his revenge by hijacking their van and their 35 day cross-country tour, deciding to perform all of their shows by himself. But when his manager insists he take on fresh faced singer-songwriter Chelsea Mitchell as an opening act, Aaron and “the new girl” quickly need to make nice in order to survive life on the road. Coming from different backgrounds and having different\r\nviews on life, love, and music, they initially rub each other the wrong way. Soon, Aaron and Chelsea realize that they have more in common than they would have originally thought. And once they enlist the help of Aaron’s estranged high school best friend, Dan the Drummer, the three musicians travel the country playing music and becoming a family along the way.",
