Grab it and have some fun. Dr. Quantum needs your help!”<br />\r\n8/10 – OPNOOBS.COM<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“The Temporal Invasion definitely feels cheesy at times, especially when it tries to connect so many different ideas and conspiracy theories; however, after puzzle hunting for a while, it does a great job making you feel like a detective.”<br />\r\n- Steamified.com  (Silversuriv)<br />\r\n",
