Without you, we wouldn't be here!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>RAM BOE is a witty puzzle game inspired by the classic Sokoban, but with a twist. Instead of having to position blocks in different marked places, in RAM BOE you have to combine them and place them all in the mystical well of revival. That idea set it up for some really mind-boggling puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"> <li> a cute and fuzzy ram as the main character<br> </li><li> 55 levels of brain-bending puzzling action<br> </li><li> cartoonish graphics<br> </li><li> did i mention we have a cute ram?<br> </li><li> achievements, a leaderboard and trading cards<br> </li><li> mouse+keyboard/gamepad friendly controls<br> </li><li> a level sandbox connected with steam workshop so you can build/share levels<br> </li><li> handpicked background songs from the famous Kevin Macleod<br> </li><li> an adorable ra...nevermind :))</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CHARACTER</strong></h2><br>Meet Boe the Ram, his full name is Beauregard Pete, but we use Boe out of commodity. He wasn't always a ram, he used to be an adventurer, he loved to climb mountains and hug trees. It all took a turn for the worse when he heard about this ice demon terrorizing the mountain tops. He went to slay it, but he was no match. His soul was trapped in a rune stone by the jotun and after struggling for a while, he escaped and possessed a ram. That's how RAM BOE was born: one part man, one part wool, one part horns and a lot of parts cuddly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE TEAM</strong></h2><br>      Greetings, we are a small group of friends that love video games. So we thought &quot;hey, why not learn how to make video games&quot; and so here we are. The team is composed of five people, hence the name of the team. This is our first attempt at a computer game and we are thrilled that we received so much attention and we promise to keep surpassing our limits in game-making.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THANK YOU</strong></h2><br>We thank each and every one of you, our voters, our commentators, our players, heck even you, the guy reading this right now! All that hard work and sweat can't compare with the moment you have the game finished and people are making a hype over it. We had a lot of fun making it and we hope you will enjoy playing it.",
