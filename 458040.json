Be Creative.</h2>Hex Gambit is a short form, competitive strategy game that lets players surprise each other in plain sight. It's designed to be as fun to watch as it is to play. Characters jump across the board like checkers pieces, and their moves compliment each other for bold, game-changing plays. Your strongest abilities unlock automatically as your score increases, so each match is a race to unleash a game-winning gambit. Battles take around 15 minutes for experienced players.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/458040/extras/crowdsurf.jpg?t=1539630076\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Jump Over Anyone</h2>Our checkers-inspired movement mechanic, called crowdsurfing, makes getting around the board a fun puzzle in and of itself. Bounce over the head of any neighboring unit to land on the opposite side, and that’s chainable if a bunch of characters are standing in a line. What would be a traffic jam in most TBS games is a wealth of options in Hex Gambit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose Your Squad</h2>Before each match, you’ll select a squad of 5 minion classes and a captain, who provides a unique Ultimate to help you out of tough situations. There are 7 diverse minion classes to choose from: Soldier, Sniper, Brute, Runner, Pacifist, Defender, and Motivator. That's 21 different team combinations, times 6 captains.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master</h2>A quick setup phase skips right to the good stuff: arrange some starter minions however you like on your side of the map. Victory Points are awarded for minion kills, and for each time you can “tap” a crystal pillar on the hostile side of the map.
