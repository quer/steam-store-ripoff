Be aware, though, that your enemies level up with you—as you amass XP for a high score, you also make the game that much more challenging for yourself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CURRENT FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>15-minute VR gaming sessions — a brief, intense VR exploration and combat experience!<br></li><li>Kinetic reloading mechanics — to reload you handgun, you need to eject the spent mag/drum (press Menu on your dominant hand), grab a replacement from your ammo pouch (with your off hand), and slot it into the weapon before you can fire<br></li><li>Trackpad walking — for more a immersive experience!<br></li><li>Keep your holosword handy...for close encounters — Out of ammo? Carve a path through the enemy until you can find more!<br></li><li>RPG-lite, rogue-like character advancement (collect XP to advance your Level, which in turn increases things like your health and damage stats)<br></li><li>PERMADEATH! — you have 15 minutes; no checkpoints; no saves; you die, you start over<br></li><li>Rogue-like &quot;dungeon&quot; — levels are selected at random from a large pool; we will be expanding the pool of levels over time too, until players should rarely ever see the same level<br></li><li>All enemy spawn locations are random<br></li><li>Enemies level with you and the game increases in difficulty as you progress deeper into the spacestation<br></li><li>No two plays through will be the same — endless replayability!<br></li><li>Old-school difficulty — surviving to reach the escape point should provide a profound sense of accomplishment</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON CURRENTLY</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>We're adding a new Marathon game mode that allows for saving at the start of a new Floor, but still features Permadeath (to maintain that Rogue-like feel)<br></li><li>We're adding the next set of environment art assets (models and textures) and building a new set of levels based on these new assets.<br></li><li>We’re experimenting with modifying the player shooting model to allow for critical hits (e.g. on head-shots).<br></li><li>We’re starting to replace the placeholder audio files with Final audio assets.
