Cloudlands is a virtual reality minigolf experience like you've never experienced before.  Be transported to a beautifully landscaped island archipelago above the clouds.  This demo includes only a single player experience with a few holes to play.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/458930/extras/AboutGameHeader02.jpg?t=1459841759\" ><br>You will find no swing or power meters in Cloudlands.  Cloudlands uses an intuitive 1:1 control mapping between the virtual putter and your Vive controller.  Expect your real-life skills to translate into the virtual world (oh no!).  Don't worry though.  It's mini golf!  Everyone can have fun and play.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/458930/extras/AboutGameHeader03.jpg?t=1459841759\" ><br>Cloudlands includes one fantastical 18 hole course.  The course is split between 3 different seasons so expect to see summer, autumn, and winter themed holes.  Expect to be challenged by ball cannons, floating bridges, spinning obstacles, and multi-island holes.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/458930/extras/AboutGameHeader04.jpg?t=1459841759\" ><br>What could be better than playing Cloudlands by yourself?  Playing with friend and family of course!  We offer local multiplayer (only 1 VR Headset required) so you can play a competitive round from the comfort of your own home.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/458930/extras/AboutGameHeader05.jpg?t=1459841759\" ><br>We will be offering online multiplayer as a free update shortly after launch.  While the feature is completed on our end, we are thoroughly testing it to make sure the experience is as smooth and bug free as possible before we put it in your hands.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/458930/extras/AboutGameHeader06.jpg?t=1459841759\" ><br>Bored of the existing holes and want to play some new ones?  Shortly after launch we will be including (for free), a course editor to allow you to build, share, and play other user created holes.  Build in god mode and instantly play your course in real time.  Lock your pieces to a grid or use complete free form to create some ridiculous holes never before seen or played before.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/458930/extras/AboutGameHeader07.jpg?t=1459841759\" ><br>Over 20 challenging Steam Achievements to test your precision and accuracy with a putter",
