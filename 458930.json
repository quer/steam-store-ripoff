Cloudlands is a virtual reality minigolf experience like you've never experienced before.  Be transported to a beautifully landscaped island archipelago above the clouds.  This demo includes only a single player experience with a few holes to play.<br><br><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/458930/extras/AboutGameHeader02.jpg?t=1459841759\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br>You will find no swing or power meters in Cloudlands.  Cloudlands uses an intuitive 1:1 control mapping between the virtual putter and your Vive controller.  Expect your real-life skills to translate into the virtual world (oh no!).  Don't worry though.  It's mini golf!  Everyone can have fun and play.<br><br><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/458930/extras/AboutGameHeader03.jpg?t=1459841759\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br>Cloudlands includes one fantastical 18 hole course.  The course is split between 3 different seasons so expect to see summer, autumn, and winter themed holes.
