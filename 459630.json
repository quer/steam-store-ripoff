This way of handling gameplay makes sure no game session is like the one before and that the player can feel like playing with real machines because of the realistic interaction with the environment.

Do not fall from high altitude! Life does not get easier with one leg gone. Watch shadows and day and night: your bot is powered by latest ultrafast solar technology and he likes to drain his battery with his thrusters, cannon and toys. Upgrade your bot and unlock new islands with the reward money you earn from the Iridium Targets.
