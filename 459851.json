Fruit specifically for Gremlins, Inc. (including one bonus track that is not available anywhere in the game). A. Fruit comes from the background of producing bass music, with her tracks commercially released in compilations in USA, UK, Japan, Russia, Poland and Argentina. She is based in Moscow and frequently performs as a DJ in Russian and European music clubs. <br><br>The collaboration between Charlie Oscar and A. Fruit started in Vilnius in the summer of 2015. Throughout the following years, A. Fruit created over 300 custom sound effects and 27 original music tracks. In her own words: &quot;this album is mostly experimental stuff made with the sounds of old clocks and other mechanic noises I've recorded. Being composed with vintage instruments and mixed with the interface sounds of the game, it reminds of the electroswing and the hip-hop music, but with the atmosphere of an industrial steampunk town.&quot;<br><br><strong>SIDE A</strong> (main themes, re-mastered)<br>–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br><br>1.
