How to do it? Blowing down the Government Palace of course! But none can do it alone, you’ll have to coordinate squads of rioters to get weapons and medikits by destroying strategic buildings, to find the better route to the Palace and to overcome policemen formations or tanks blocking your path. But remember: every action causes an equal and opposite reaction.<br>The police will not stay just looking at your moves…<br><br>On one side you will control the leader of the revolt in third person view . So, you have to find a melee weapon to smash things and enemies. You can pick up and throw urban props. <br>When you find molotov cocktails and fire crackers you can store them and throw them when it’s time. And yes, you can throw stones anytime you need. <br><br>On the other side you will enjoy a RTS game. Do you remember “Hooligans”? Well, it is something like that . Around the leader there will be an area of influence. All the rioters who will enter in this area will follow the leader’s orders. You can't have a full control on them since it’s a revolt but you can put them in 4 moods: <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/stop.png?t=1486677761\" ><br><br>Rioters will simply stand still and run away if the police come closer <br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/follow.png?t=1486677761\" ><br><br>Rioters will follow the leader, but be careful not to run too fast, you can lose some of them <br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/launch.png?t=1486677761\" ><br><br>Rioters will throw stones by default and will also use molotov cocktails and fire crackers when looted, keeping a safety distance from the enemies <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/attack.png?t=1486677761\" ><br><br>Rioters will attack melee policemen or tanks in their range, if not, they will waste buildings and vehicles<br><br>So it’s important what you do as an individual and how you act as a strategy leader.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/tit1bis.png?t=1486677761\" ><br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/feature12.png?t=1486677761\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/feature34.png?t=1486677761\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/feature56.png?t=1486677761\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/461190/extras/feature8.png?t=1486677761\" >",
