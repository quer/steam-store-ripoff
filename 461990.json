Because there is no security and authority in these cities, prisoners have to defend themselves and try to survive. They can be attacked unexpectedly by another prisoner at any time, or they can be bitten by a wild dog. The purpose of the game is to hide, fight and survive.<br><br>In order to make money out of it, the government decides to convert all of these into a national TV show.
