Their fleets excel at long range, with powerful weapons dealing massive amounts of damage from afar. Skilled Tau admirals can eliminate the bulk of an enemy fleet before they can even get within boarding distance.

They have special functions and traits unique to each ship:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Kroot Warsphere</strong> – Battle Cruiser able to fire at any angle and impervious to almost all critical damage. Cannot turn, except when given an ‘All Ahead Full’ command in a new direction.<br></li><li><strong>Nicassar Dhow</strong> – Escort ship that can only be deployed through specially upgraded Tau ships’ abilities.<br></li><li><strong>Bastion Demiurg</strong> – Low-cost Battle Cruiser that’s weaker but features 4 skill slots to support the fleet with.<br></li><li><strong>Stronghold Demiurg</strong> – High-cost Battle Cruiser with stats almost matching that of a Battleship.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tau Warfare System</h2>Unique to the Tau faction, players can make a decision on the overall strategy for the upcoming battle during the mission at hand, granting special bonuses.

This reduces the enemy troop value by 5 and quadruples the chance of destroying a targeted subsystem (this also applies to weapon-sourced critical damage).<br></li><li>Kauyon Path – Your fleet becomes far more accurate at long-range.
