The FM Synth soundtrack creates an effect like watching an 80s action movie on a dusty VHS cassette. The cherry on top is fast-paced dodge-and-destroy gameplay against a rogues gallery of killer robots.”<br>7/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamespew.com/2016/06/mecha-ritz-steel-rondo-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameSpew</a><br>",
