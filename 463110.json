More of an interactive storybook than a traditional point-and-click adventure, the tale is told primarily through a text pane at the bottom of the screen, with static illustrations above and a verb list on the left. Everything that happens is described in the gentle style of a children's story, and the game promises that every action you can take will get a unique response.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/news/view/30698\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Adventure Gamers</a><br>",
