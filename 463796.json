The new skin is applied when downloaded (to revert, simply uninstall).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wyrmscales</h2>Save perhaps for the greater daemons of Chaos, there is no more fearsome creature in the Old World than a dragon. These massive, winged wyrms are both ancient and powerful beyond the comprehension of most mortals. A dragon’s claw is tipped by talons that are each the size of a full-grown man, and their mighty jaws can snap a thick oak in two. The most feared weapon in the dragon’s arsenal is its breath: some dragons spew gouts of searing flame, while others blast their foes with acidic vapours or poisonous fumes. The very wise can tell what a dragon can breathe by the colour of its scales.",
