The new skin is applied when downloaded (to revert, simply uninstall).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Studded Leather</h2>To survive on the harsh mountain slopes without the security of a nearby hold to fall back to, Rangers have learned to be stealthy and to fight in a manner unique for Dwarfs. They are ambush-hunters, experts at approaching the enemy from unexpected angles. Where possible, they will trigger avalanches, misdirect wayward foes over cliffs, or lead them into the teeth of an oncoming ice storm. Rangers are walking arsenals and carry a slew of different weapons - crossbows to skewer foes at long range, an axe for close combat and, for truly imposing foes, great axes. They have learned to keep bedrolls, pots, pans, and climbing gear secreted in camps hidden along their mountainous routes, yet still, they must carry all their provisions on their backs as well.",
