            "detailed_description": "<h1>Why subscription?</h1><p><i>Note: everything below is about the official MMO world only. The single-player mode and unofficial private servers are available without subscribing.</i><br><br>Screeps is an unusual MMO game that has no counterparts at the moment. There are numerous online games where your character exists in the game world only while you’re online and disappears after you exit the game. There are fewer games that have your character or units continue some defined automatic activity even after logging out. But only Screeps runs your scripts in full continuously, on the <strong>24/7 basis</strong>, and you are allowed to use them for anything JavaScript allows. <br><br>This makes Screeps more like a hosting or cloud computing service rather than a traditional online game. We offer you <strong>server CPU time</strong> and fixed amount of memory that you can use as you wish (though it’s still preferable to use it in relation with the game!). Though a new player gets a quite low initial CPU limit, after upgrading your game level you can end up with your limit up to 300 ms per game tick which is quite a serious hosting asset. <br><br>As we designed the game, we were considering numerous options and finally came to a conclusion that justification of such expenses requires only one model: game time (or, in our case, CPU time) subscription. And note that we don’t offer multiple subscription options: the subscription cost is the same for all players. Thus we avoid creating game advantages for certain groups of players since all are provided with equal opportunities to use server resources. <br><br>If you don’t wish to use such resources on general terms, you can just confine yourself to purchasing a starter kit on Steam. A minimum 20 CPU amount will be reserved for you on the official MMO server, but it won’t grow following your game level. That's a perfectly fine way to play Screeps too, since we have a standalone non-subscription world shard, where you can compete with other non-subscription players on equal terms.</p><br><h1>Subscription Tokens</h1><p><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/464350/Subscription%20Token\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  ><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/464350/extras/steam_market_screenshot4.png?t=1545381719\" ></a><br><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/464350/Subscription%20Token\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Subscription Token</a> is a special in-game item that allows its owner to activate 60 days of CPU subscription. You can buy a subscription token the same way as a regular CPU subscription, but these items are tradeable, you can sell them to another player or buy for game resources.<br><br>Hence, those players who want to share their resources with others can play Screeps as a free-to-play game! Subscription tokens trading is possible via the in-game market or <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/464350/Subscription%20Token\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Community Market</a> allowing to trade purchased tokens for real currency using your Steam Wallet.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><i><strong>Screeps is about scripting your creeps.</strong> </i><br><br>It is an open source MMO RTS sandbox game for programming enthusiasts, wherein the core mechanic is <strong>programming your units AI</strong>. With all the attributes of a full-fledged strategy game, you control your colony by writing <strong>real JavaScript</strong> which operates 24/7 in the single persistent world filled by other players on par with you.<br><br>Your colony can <strong>harvest</strong> resources, <strong>build</strong> units, <strong>conquer</strong> territory, <strong>trade</strong> with other colonies. As you conquer more territory, your influence in the game world grows, as well as your abilities to expand your footprint. But beware, multiple players aiming for the same territory may lead to conflict!<br><br>Screeps is developed for people with programming skills. Unlike some other RTS games, your units in Screeps can react to events without your participation – provided that you have programmed them properly. And, unlike other MMO, you do not have to play Screeps constantly to play well. It is quite enough just to check once in a while to see if everything goes well.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> You play by writing JavaScript AI which controls your units 24/7 even while you're offline.<br><br></li><li> Units of all players coexist in the same real-time huge persistent world and obey the same rules.<br><br></li><li> Many kinds of units, base building, mining resources, territory control, economy, manufacturing, transporting, logistics, trading—all the attributes of a real strategy game which you need to program!<br><br></li><li> The better your scripts, the better your game—irrespective of the time played.
