She is not easily pleased, but what god is? To prove your worth you must perform sacrifices according to Inanna’s sacred rituals. Place your workers in workshops to gain resources and goats. Offer up the resources to Inanna and use the goats to trade for new workshops and abilities.

Each day, you and your competitors will awaken at dawn to begin your worship. Run and jump around the ziggurat to place your workers so they'll collect resources. You only have 2 workers, so you better figure out your strategy, move fast, and claim workshops before your friends beat you to it!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> </h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Real-time Dynamic Auctions!</strong></h2><br>Whoever is willing to sacrifice the most goats gets Inanna's blessing! The auction is simple — just move left or right to change your bid in real time. Each auction is a mind game of bluffing and bravado, and you never know an item’s real price until time is up!
