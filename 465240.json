Also, there's a sword and a shield, for good measure.<br></li><li><strong>Planet-hopping action</strong> – Visit five unique planets, and battle across treacherous Egyptian sands, in the pitch-dark under ancient ruins, or on the surface of Pladeon, the long-abandoned heart of a great industrial civilization.<br></li><li><strong>Dick's back, too!</strong> - Featuring the voice of Serious Sam, John. J. Dick, dropping one-liners almost as fast as you drop your enemies.<br></li><li><strong>Cry for Mummy</strong> – Defeat Mental's most powerful servants, starting with the Unholy Space Mummy of Gamma Pegasi, a huge undead monstrosity brought to life with dark magic - as dangerous as it is smelly! And that's just the first boss, and there are five of them - each one more deadly and terrifying than the last.<br></li><li><strong>Upgrade and improve</strong> - Evolve your arsenal and yourself, unlocking 36 powerups and 190 weapon upgrades during Sam's adventures.<br></li><li><strong>It takes two to tango</strong> - Play through any level with a partner, picking between Serious Sam or Serious Sammy as your character of choice.<br></li><li><strong>Randomly Generated Gameplay!</strong> - This new gameplay option is split to three different modes.
