            "detailed_description": "<h1>A Note on Early Access</h1><p>Let's talk brass tacks here: The last time Can't Drive This was updated, is a while in the past. Unfortunately, this won't change until the game's full release in Q4 2018. This is because the game grew organically from game-jam code, which – at some point – just became too unstable for us to keep developing upon it. That threw us back quite a bit, as we began reworking the whole thing.<br><br>The good news is, that this will help CDT run far more smoothly. It allows us to improve network play, improve graphics, and increase the scope of the game. If you're thinking about getting into Can't Drive This during Early Access, please keep this in mind.<br><br>The game you'll get before launch is not complete, and the issues likely won't be fixed until launch day. If you're okay with that, and still want to support the development of the game, then thank you, from the bottom of our hearts!<br><br>One last word, for anybody who might be worried: Can't Drive This is fully funded, and will be definitely completed. It's not dead, it hasn't been cancelled or abandoned. All revenue from the Early Access version are going into adding more features and goodies to the full version.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Can't What Now?</h2>Can't Drive This is a competitive co-op multiplayer party racing game (if that's a thing). Drive your car WHILE your friend builds the road in front of you! Oh, and don't go too slow, OR YOU'LL EXPLODE! Like in that Sandra Bullock movie, in which she kinda does the same thing, but on a bus. Also, she doesn't explode (Spoiler alert). Also, Keanu Reeves was in the movie.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Co-Op Multiplayer Goodness</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play local face-to-face couch co-op, with your best frenemy! Don't have two controllers? No worries, one keyboard and one mouse serves two players! Don't have keyboard and mouse? Well, that's weird. (Warning: Can't Drive This may cause you to erratically scream at your friend.) <br></li><li>Or, if you don't have actual real-life friends, find some random internet-person to play! That's right, we've got cross-platform online multiplayer! Experience the joy of playing Can't Drive This without that annoying smelly friend next to you. You know who I'm talking about.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customization!</h2>Where's the fun in online multiplayer if there's no customization, you ask? You're very correct, which is why Can't Drive This features a gazillion* unlockable parts and a vehicle editor so you can show off your awesomeness to everybody on the interweb! But as we all know, only one player gets to drive a car at a time. The other player builds the track. That's why we also included a track editor! Create your custom track and have your friends race on a gold-plated yellow brick road, if you so wish!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Feature List</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Racing Game (What the game is)<br></li><li> Level-Editor (The game is this, too!)<br></li><li> Customizable Vehicles<br></li><li> Customizable Race Tracks<br></li><li> Cross-Platform Online Multiplayer<br></li><li> Local Multiplayer</li></ul><br>*Not actually a gazillion parts. Not actually sure if gazillion is even a real number.",
