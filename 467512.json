Many of those villains are prideful and would not deign to work with others, as their goals would not align. However, some of them have seen the value of cooperating towards a common goal. And those have joined forces, even at cross purposes, to defeat the heroes who have harried them for so long.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of these villains, such as Plague Rat or Biomancer, are more hesitant to work with other villains. Whereas others, such as Citizens Hammer &amp; Anvil or Sergeant Steel, are more than happy to join forces with other like-minded combatants.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVillains of the Multiverse is a mega-expansion for Sentinels of the Multiverse. It uses the villain team gameplay style introduced in Sentinels of the Multiverse: Vengeance to group villains together as a team fighting against the hero team.
