Like most games, you start at point A and have to get to point B before your adversaries.

How come? Because one player at the table will take up the mantle of &quot;Mr. Game,&quot; an arbitrator who has the final say on decisions whenever the rules of the game come into question. The rules of the game come into question a lot - by design! That means Mr. Game has free license to create and clarify rules at his or her leisure, making no two games of Mr. Game! ever exactly the same.<br><br>Unfair, you say? Don't worry - Mr. Game is bound by an official code of conduct:<br><br>  •  All players are responsible for interpreting the rules of the game, but Mr. Game makes the final decisions.<br>  •  All rules Mr. Game creates must apply to all players equally, themselves included.<br>  •  If Mr. Game breaks a rule or attempts to chance a decision they already made, the other players may revolt and forcibly replace them.<br>  •  After the game ends, players choose a new Mr. Game for the next game. Any decisions made by the previous Mr. Game no longer need to be enforced.<br><br><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions:</u></strong><br><br>Q.

He was framed, honestly. But it did happen. That's in 3 years of designing, developing, and testing. Not a bad record.<br><br>Q. How does the goal change?<br>A. There are 5 cards in the deck that change the goal to a random number. 4 of the cards are Actions, meaning they must be played when drawn. 1 is a Badge, which means you can lie in wait and play it when the moment is right.<br><br>Q.
