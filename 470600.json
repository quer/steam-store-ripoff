Over the past year there’s been many changes, including our development team.<br><br><strong>What happened?</strong><br>As you may already know, the first version was made with the Construct Game Engine. Initially, this was not the right decision due to its limitations so we then decided to move the EA-version of the game to Unity. This could’ve solved all the problems, but the technical quality of the development failed us. Work slowed down, and further plans for gameplay have not been implemented. A series of poor decisions have led the published version to be buggy, unplayable, empty, and will require a complete overhaul.<br><br><strong>What will happen with the project now?</strong><br>We have read all of your feedback and we know that you are waiting for the final, playable version. Currently, we are not ready to name the exact date of when we will resume work on the game due to the fact that the project will have to be made completely from scratch again.<br>Our new team is now fully occupied with Bitcoin Mining Empire, and only after its full release, which is not earlier than the summer of 2018, we will be able to make a decision about further working on VBS. We are very sorry to leave Video Blogger Story in this state, because currently, not even the tenth of our plans and your wonderful ideas have been implemented. Even though we really do not want to bury the project under the gravestone &quot;another abandoned game on Steam&quot;, fow now we can not make a decision on the project’s remake, since it would require a large effort from our entire team.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Hello dear friend. Thank you for your interest in our project.<br>The idea of the game originated back in 2015. At the end of December, we successfully passed greenlight, but due to unavoidable circumstances the development has dragged on, and has even been frozen for a while.<br>Competition has forced us to accelerate the pace, but not to turn off the chosen path!<br>Now the game is in the early access, and we welcome any of your suggestions and comments.<br><br><strong>What can be done in &quot;Video Blogger Story&quot; right now?</strong><br><br>1.
