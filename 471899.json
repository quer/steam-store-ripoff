Design studies for a &quot;super bomber&quot; were requested by the U.S. Army Air Corps in November 1939, with a contract for the first two XB-29s™ being awarded in September 1940. The first flight took place in Seattle, Washington in 1941. Various system and structural modifications were made to aircraft following the early test flights. The B-29™ featured a number of firsts, including a fully pressurized cabin, electronic fire-control system, and a 20,000lbs bomb load. It rapidly found favour with crews thanks to its size, speed and range.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Full virtual cockpit with gauges and controls <br></li><li>Accurate and functional Engineer's Station <br></li><li>Bare-metal bump-mapped 2048-pixel texture sets <br></li><li>Animated doors and togglable bomb load <br></li><li>Custom engine start-up smoke (note: engines should be started individually) <br></li><li>Togglable animated crew figures with period flight gear <br></li><li>Illustrated user manual PDF <br></li><li>Soundset by Sonic Solutions. <br></li><li>Paintkit files provided.</li></ul> <br>**Note – this aircraft does not features a  2D panel<br><br><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/471899/extras/BOEING.jpg?t=1537257713\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">",
