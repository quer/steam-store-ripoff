The Late Anglo-Saxon era in English history is a time of warring Earls. Minor kings all, they claim whatever lands they can.

All the while, the Vikings roam not just the sea, but the land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is truly a Dark Age. Or is it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is Ortus Regni, “the birth of the kingdom.”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ancient world is dead. The world is reborn. Anyone can become a king through politics and diplomacy – or by the blade. And it is always, in the end, by the blade. Will it be you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrtus Regni is a unique closed-deck, deck-design strategy card game. Players take the role of great Earls vying to control what will become England. Ortus Regni was inspired not only by Anglo-Saxon history, but also by the art of illuminated medieval manuscripts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQUICK AND EASY DECK BUILDING: Or let the app build you one, and the save the decks you like. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTUTORIAL SYSTEM: Journey through the basics of the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCOMPLETE CARD SET INCLUDED: no in game “currency” or card harvesting. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNOVEL STRATEGIC CARD GAME INTERFACE: Pictorial cards and a replicated tabletop experience. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrtus Regni is based off of the premium tabletop card game of the same name.
