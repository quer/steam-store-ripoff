Each run through the procedurally sequenced mines and temples offers a unique path through a variety of challenges against upgraded enemy combatants and three intense boss fights.<br><br><strong>Faejin Combat Style:</strong> The nw Faejin Combat Style blends defense and offense with percussive strikes and fluid power. The new approach is a complex style for experienced Absolvers, featuring shifting defensive abilities and two dozen attacks for bare hands, wargloves, and armed combat.<br><br><strong>School Challenges:</strong> Absolvers who have reached the Disciple rank in a school can participate in School challenges, by using their school’s decks and powers in 1v1 Combat Trials. All wins representing one’s school count in the School challenges, with individual and collective performances of the schools bringing fresh rewards every three weeks, at the end of the season.</p><br><h1>Digital Deluxe Edition</h1><p><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/473690/extras/AbsolverDeluxe.png?t=1538944712\" ><br>The Absolver: Deluxe Edition includes the official soundtrack from Austin Wintory and The Art of Absolver 52-page digital artbook.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>In the ruins of the fallen Adal Empire, you awaken with a mysterious mask on your face, and faint recollections of an esoteric ceremony. Freeing you from hunger, thirst, and even death, the mask is the creation of the Guides, the rulers of these lands, who have placed you here to determine whether you are worthy of becoming part of the elite corps of Absolvers. As you wander these forsaken lands, encountering other Prospects like you, you will learn new combat styles, acquire weapons, gear and armor, and build a team of warriors with whom to fight side by side in Arenas of combat.<br><br>Please visit the official Absolver FAQ on the Steam discussion board for more information: <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/app/473690/discussions/0/2579854400733819593/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://steamcommunity.com/app/473690/discussions/0/2579854400733819593/</a><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/473690/extras/AbsolverHype.png?t=1538944712\" ></h2><br><br><strong>Fluid Real-Time Combat: </strong>Position yourself in one of four tactical stances during real-time battles and execute devastating attacks, dodges, and parries.

These moments are filled with tension as intentions to battle or befriend are never clear: trust is always a leap of faith.
