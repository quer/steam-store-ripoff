We worked on the game for over a year to finally complete it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis are the new features and updates done to the game: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n•Over 100 Bugs and Crashing bugs fixed! <br />\r\n•Added a whole new world and levels (Volcano) <br />\r\n•Added Menu, cut-scenes and ending. <br />\r\n•Implemented password system <br />\r\n•Designed, developed and implemented boss fights (4) according to the original game story. <br />\r\n•Organized the game to be able to play with continuity. <br />\r\n•Over 40 levels and 10 hours of gameplay! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a puzzle adventure platformer in which you got to help Dorke (and Ymp) to do some errands for your evil Master Wizard in exchange of training you and teaching you his magic spells. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is very very hard and challenging, but hardcore games will have fun playing it!",
