Opening your eyes you see the stone walls of the chamber flickering by the light of the fire; you stumble to your feet and kick a helmet clattering across the floor.  Slowly the ache in your head begins to subside and you notice the beginnings of a passage.  After a few steps the darkness consumes you.  Returning to the safely of the fire you see a LIDAR scanner on the floor - a trigger press results in a faint glow coming from inside the helmet.  You put the helmet on, adjust the beam-width and proceed into the abyss….<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInspired by Gone Home and Dear Esther, Scanner Sombre is a cave exploration experience.
