Split into three separate modes, Survival, Mercenary and Arcade, even the introduction to Island 359 doles out plenty of intense action, giving a brief glimpse at the legendary T-Rex.”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/02/review-island-359/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VR Focus</a><br><br>“Almost two years removed from the launch window of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, Island 359 — a game that’s been in Early Access for almost just as long — has evolved from its humble beginnings into a shining example of not only quality VR gaming, but how to improve a project while in Early Access. They iterated on what worked and expanded in areas that were lacking until Island 359 became just as polished as it was ambitious. It’s still not for everyone, but fans of tense action games, shooters, and hardcore survival games owe it to themselves to get lost in the lush jungles of Island 359.”<br>8.5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://uploadvr.com/island-359-full-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Upload</a><br>",
