You are a defense commander on FOUR distant asteroid colonies, tasked with protecting the mines from saboteur competitors. You tower above the colony in VR, carefully timing volleys of phaser fire to destroy the inbound projectiles, as well as defending against ground assaults from lumbering mechs and attacking hordes of enemy spacecraft! When things get too crazy, use the time distortion button to slow things down. But use it wisely...you have a limited supply! A steady aim, quick reflexes, and keeping cool under pressure are all critical if you want to survive the onslaught. Inbound is non-stop, 2-handed arcade action in a beautifully immersive VR landscape that will truly make you feel you've been to other worlds.<br><br><strong>Inbound</strong> is arcade-style action...if you like games such as (the excellent) Space Pirate Trainer, chances are you will really enjoy Inbound as well! Grab some friends and compete for high scores on the four included worlds!",
