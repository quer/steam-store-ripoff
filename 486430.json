You must take control of the little dude, his spikes are not just for decoration, they help him climb up certain walls and steep slopes so you can collect the four red cubes in each of 24 levels to open the exits to be able to access all 3 different worlds.<br><br>Time is life and in Sphoxie this is very literal, the enemies will steal your time and falling of the level will really make you lose time, don't fret because time flows both ways, you can get more time by collecting the yellow and red cubes or knocking the bad guys into the ether. The little dude is not totally defenseless because he has a special blast power and by slamming into anything hard enough unleashes a powerful shock-wave that will knock anything away. This power will be very useful in the boss battles where you must knock all the bosses of the platform to unlock the next world.<br><br>If you are a speed demon there is a race mode where you must beat each level (without the bad guys or yellow cubes) as fast as possible for the top time. There are various unlockables for achieving certain things in the game like different tails, sun glasses and more!<br><br>Many dangers and obstacles await, can you handle it?<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br>- 24 fun and diverse levels<br>- 3 Challenging boss fights<br>- 3 Unique worlds<br>- Simple yet deep gameplay<br>- Climb on walls<br>- Beautiful visuals powered by the Unreal Engine 4<br>- Made by just one person<br>- Achievements and Leaderboards<br>- Unlockable Customization options for your character<br>- Race mode<br>- Music by Anitek<br>- Made in the Unreal Engine<br>- And lots more!<br><br>Control with the keyboard W,A,S,D for movement and Q,E or the mouse for camera control and space for action.<br>With the controller left stick/dpad to control and right stick for the camera<br><br>If there is enough interest I can try and make a Linux &amp; OSX build",
