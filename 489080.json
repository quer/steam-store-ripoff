Each element has a recovery time, and the more powerful a spell, the more focus is requires. You'll need to balance which element, and how powerful a spell to cast, to maximize your potential, against multiple targets.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/489080/extras/fire_incinerate_64.png?t=1475644873\" ><br>There are many creatures to engage with different behaviors, strengths and weaknesses.
