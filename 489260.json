It’s not just the individual monsters alone that make Brut@l challenging though – the combination and groupings of monsters, called Squads, make the game interesting, challenging and satisfying to defeat.<br><br>Take the Minotaur, for example: the formidable part man/part bull monster uses his ferocious charge attack to inflict seriously heavy damage.

In order to survive and progress, adventurers will need to learn the skills and find the raw materials to craft and enchant weapons, brew potions and forge magical talismans to aid them on their dangerous journey from Floor 1 down to Floor 26.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapon Crafting</strong></h2>No matter how heroic they are, every adventurer will require a deadly weapon to survive the depths of Brut@l. Thankfully, weapons can be crafted by finding and combining a Weapon Codex - basically a blueprint or recipe – and combining it with the required raw materials (ASCII letters).<br><br><br>There are five weapon types in Brut@l: short-swords, long-swords, spears, hammers and bows. Each weapon type has a unique special move that can be used to turn the tide in combat, be it the ground pound from the Skullcrusher Warhammer that deals AOE damage and applies a knockback, or the charge and thrust of the Goblin Pike that allows adventurers to engage enemies quickly from a longer range.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapon Enchanting</strong></h2>Weapons are great but for the discerning adventurer on an epic quest, sometimes a deadly blade, bow, hammer or spear isn't always enough. Each weapon in Brut@l has a key ASCII letter that, when replaced with an enchanted letter, can bestow a special ability to that weapon. Engulf your enemy in flames, freeze them in place, poison them, electrocute them or even to transform their monster form!<br><br><br>Use fire-enchanted letters to craft the Flaming Thunderstrike bow which allows you to set enemies alight from a distance, or apply the mysterious arcane letters to your sword to give you a random chance of transforming your enemy into something smaller and weaker. Be careful though: arcane magic is fickle and sometimes you’ll find your foe transformed into something bigger and more deadly!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Potion Brewing</strong></h2>Potion ingredients are scattered throughout the dungeon, and adventurers can combine these ingredients to brew useful potions to aid themselves, or hinder an enemy! Be careful however, the effects of these potent potions are unknown until consumed or thrown at an enemy. Suffice to say, drinking a Potion of Inferno isn't recommended; neither is throwing a Potion of Rage at an already angry Orc!<br><br><br>Oh! Did we mention that Brut@l randomizes every potion’s color, effect and recipe on every new play through so you’re never sure which potion does what exactly? No? Well… surprise!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Talisman Forging</strong></h2>Talismans are powerful magical relics found deep within the dungeon – wearing these items can bestow special abilities upon an adventurer. For example, the Gift of Farsight which reveals the entire map or the Rune of Methuselah that grants a healthy bonus to experience points gained.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/489260/extras/co-op.png?t=1486740289\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><br>Evoke the nostalgia of all night gaming sessions from years past!
