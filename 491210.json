You can summon a log, and manipulate what type of log it is on the fly. Each of the four types serves a particular purpose. The shovel log can plant seeds to fill your wood supply, powering your lumbermancing abilities. The sword log can move quickly and perform melee attacks to kill the beasts of the woods. The torch log is needed to keep your Lumbermancer's lantern lit so that you can see your way through the dark forest. The arrow log moves slow, but can perform ranged attacks to stick arrows in enemy buns. <br><br>By controlling the wizard with one hand and your log with the other, you have to navigate your way through enemies and keep your Lumbermancer alive!<br><br><br>There are four main areas of the woods, plus an unlockable endless forest, a secret boss, and a shop.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/491210/extras/shop.png?t=1467182357\" ><br>In the shop, you can trade souls with Death to get powerful and sometimes not-so-powerful spells!

Holy Toast from the Ghost King, Witch's Lettuce from the Bell Witch, Toadmatoes from the Swamp, and a slice of the Devil's Bologna. That's not to say that it won't be dangerous.
