            "reviews": "“What I love so much about my experience with this game is that it delivers on a promise that I’ve been waiting on for so long. The idea of games as art has been bandied about for as long as I can remember, and yet this is the first time that I’ve personally interacted with a game that I felt deserved the dual classification. There’s a greater statement about abstract concepts than you’d see from most games that attempt to be “art games”, but it’s not heavy-handed in the delivery. The idea of a game that you can only complete by allowing it to play out without your intervention flies in the face of almost every concept that defines a game, and yet there is a meaningful interaction available to the player at any moment they desire. To interact with the AI a player must be willing to sacrifice a part of themselves to ask the AI to give up it’s quest.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://press2reset.com/2016/02/05/preview-den-vanstra-handens-stig/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Press2Reset</a><br><br>“After watching Den vänstra handens stig for a few minutes, and then letting that experience settle, what grabbed me was the AI’s struggle. The AI would persevere, trying and failing to reach its goals, sometimes for hours on end. All it took to make all that hard work futile was one person making them give up. The player’s exchange for the AI’s sacrifice was tiny by comparison, but still meaningful – they had to give up a bit of their humanity.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MaxwellSmith/20160226/266461/Dark_Rituals_and_Blood_Sacrifice_Den_vnstra_handens_stig.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamers Without Sarcasm</a><br><br>“It only takes one press of the game's sole button to realize that you are not the protagonist here, but the antagonist. Short programmed the pixelated character to walk, jump, and climb in an attempt to scale a mountain. Initiated onlookers know they are powerless to help, but the button calls to neophytes. At PAX South in San Antonio late last month, there were verbal altercations and individuals who physically protected the button from interlopers. The psychology of the game is only one layer to a promising experiment which should hit home computers soon.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2016-02-12/local-game-poems/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Austin Chronicle</a><br>",
