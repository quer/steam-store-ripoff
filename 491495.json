Built in the 1960s as a result of a USAF proposal for a supersonic bomber with high subsonic cruising speed and supersonic dash capabilities, the massive XB-70™ was to have carried the same bombload as the B-52 Stratofortress™ at a higher supersonic speed than the Air Force's current strategic bomber, the B-58 Hustler™. A later requirement specified that the plane be able to fly the entire mission at Mach 3.0 or greater, with a range of up to 10,500 miles and a maximum gross weight of 490,000 pounds. In the event, technology quickly relegated the Valkyrie to the role of supersonic research testbed and flagship of the USAF's public relations fleet.
