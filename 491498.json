            "detailed_description": "Convair's ™ superb F-106 Delta Dart ™ is regarded by those close to it as the best all-weather interceptor ever designed. It was created as an outgrowth of the USAF's interceptor program in 1954. The aircraft used a delta wing design, common at the time because of its immunity to many of the problems experienced by conventional wings at supersonic speeds. In December, 1959 the aircraft set a world speed record of Mach 2.31 (1,526 mph) at 40,500 feet. It was equipped with advanced Hughes fire-control systems and could be controlled from the ground to some extent. The aircraft remained in service for 28 years, ultimately being replaced by the F-15 ™in 1981 but serving with the Air National Guard until 1988.
