Slow your enemies, burn them to a crisp or even freeze them in time. Up to 5 spell tomes can be equipped at once, combining their effects together. <br><br><strong><u>Up the challenge for greater rewards</u></strong><br>Enable difficulty modifiers such as double bosses and exploding enemies, making the Necrospire far more dangerous but increasing your chances of finding rarer loot.<br><br><strong><u>Equip ancient relics</u></strong><br>Use powerful relics to summon companions to your side, teleport yourself across a room, fire deadly volleys of arrows and much, much more.<br><br><strong><u>Face challenging enemies</u></strong><br>Powerful foes await you as you climb the Necrospire.
