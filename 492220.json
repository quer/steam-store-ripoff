Each of them can be (but doesn't have to be!) refuted in a number of different ways.<br><br>In the <i>Evidence</i> menu you can familiarize yourself with testimonies of witnesses, forensic expertises, physical evidences, etc. They are grouped into appropriate categories, making them easy to find.<br><br><i>Sample:</i><br>A neighbor testified that at approximately 10 p.m. he passed you in the entrance of the tenement house, noticing that your clothes were covered in blood? Try testifying that your neighbor lies and prove that he has a reason to do so.
