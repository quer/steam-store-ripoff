Except, perhaps, that it could make a hell of a historical strategy game some day if society survived it.”<br><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/donald-trump-supreme-ruler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a><br><br>“Trump Rising is funny, but it’s also scary and that’s by design. ... It all went to hell in the first few months of 2020 though, as the world’s wars petered out. I had spent so much time selling arms to the world that I neglected all else. As the borders settled, America’s economy tanked and Trump lost his re-election bid to an avowed Socialist. ... The vote was probably rigged anyway.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/supreme-ruler-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Vice Media</a><br>",
