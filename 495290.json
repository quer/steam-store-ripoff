Anything Windows recognizes as a USB Game Controller will work, or anything that can output PPM connected via our AccuRC Dongle. An XBox style controller can work, although you most likely will not get the full RC flying experience from it. AccuRC is not flyable without a controller.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The first version of AccuRC flight simulator was released in 2014. Since then, thousands of RC pilots have been enjoying the most sophisticated and realistic aerodynamic simulation ever produced. After continuous program of free upgrades, we’re now about to release version 2.1 which makes the AccuRC available on Steam, with all the advantages of ease of access, instant availability and slimmed down supply chain, passing the savings on to you, the customer. <br><br>AccuRC offers RC fliers unique benefits unavailable with any other RC simulator.<br><br>Each and every model and component in the sim are created entirely as the original, often using CAD files from the manufacturers themselves. Here are some of the companies we have worked with in the past and are currently working with, enabling us to represent their products as accurately as possible:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>BK Designs LLC<br></li><li>Compass Models<br></li><li>GAUI TSH<br></li><li>HD Helicopters<br></li><li>KST Servos<br></li><li>Mikado USA and VTX Designs<br></li><li>Minicopter<br></li><li>MSH USA<br></li><li>OptiPower<br></li><li>SAB Heli Division<br></li><li>SAVÖX<br></li><li>Scorpion Power System Limited<br></li><li>Synergy RC<br></li><li>Velos Rotors<br></li><li>XLPower</li></ul><br>Our simulator is designed to simulate the entire model from the servos to the blades and control surfaces, with control geometries and components accurately affecting the way things feel– it's not just simply a picture of a model.
