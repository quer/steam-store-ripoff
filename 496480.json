Vex is a casual yet challenging game, reminiscent of the early days of video games, but with a more modern feel. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/496480/extras/banner.png?t=1529594378\" ><br><br>You are tasked with navigating through the dynamically difficult levels. Each level is logic based, sometimes requiring a complex plan, but often testing your reactions, timing, dexterity and agility. From lava traps and firearm turrets, to teleporters and speed boosters, Vex is a 3D arcade-style platform game, beautifully crafted using a modern game engine. This game isn't for those who only know how to battle hard, but for those who can also think logically in demanding situations.

In the 4th Dimension, the Quanta dimension, you are entangled with a secondary player. Anything that you do, affects the other player.

You become a phantom, you confuse your enemies, as you can vanish and reappear in an almost creepy fashion. However, if you die while controlling either player, both players will be killed, since the actions of one affects the other.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/496480/extras/DimensionsSmall.png?t=1529594378\" ><br>There are 4 main dimensions: Pura, Ignis, Glacium and Quanta.

Pura (latin for pure) is the vanilla, 'normal' dimension, with land and sea, fauna and flora. It is not too challenging, and acts as a tutorial world. Ignis (latin for fire) is the fire dimension, featuring lava traps, volcanoes and totems, all of which, are deadly. Glacium (derived from the word latin for ice) is the ice dimension, which includes rock falls, stalagmites and snow storms.
