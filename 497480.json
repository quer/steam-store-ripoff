With careful aim, strong spacial awareness, and the good sense to avoid traps, you will maximize your score in several single player and local multiplayer modes.

In the 1600s it was a noble game, played by King's and Princes, and widely known enough to be referenced by Shakespeare. In the 1900s, it's association with gambling and disreputable underground clubs made it synonymous with the decline of morals, especially in regards to youths. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, it became more widely accepted, found in rec rooms all throughout the world. <br><br><br>After the great starship migration of the 2300s, the space pilgrims adapted the game to work in low gravity. Originally known as &quot;Gravity Pool&quot;, the name was shortened to &quot;GravPool&quot; for brevity. Though the space migration has since ended, through your handy SimZin connection (or an old HTC Vive Virtual reality system if you are an antique collector), you can play a simulated version of this game that was used by lonely space pilgrims to pass the time. <br><br><br>It is a modification of the flat, frictionless physics game into the third dimension. Instead of aiming for pockets on a flat plane, you have six degrees of freedom with which to aim your shots. There are some new obstacles that make things a little more chaotic.
