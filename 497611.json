Both the British Pound and the Euro are near collapse and the global stock markets have not yet recovered from the initial shock of the British move.

Greece, still tottering economically and staggering under the pressure of hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming in from across the Mediterranean has been forced into yet another election campaign. Portugal and Spain have seen the small economic gains they have made in the past few years washed away in the monetary disaster which is hitting them very hard.  Eastern European countries are becoming more ‘hard line’ in response to refugees and asking the EU government in Brussels some very tough questions vis-à-vis the costs and benefits of the union. <br><br>Both the Scottish National party, which is in the process of organizing a 2nd referendum to leave the UK, and the Basque Separatists in Spain are now leading the few remaining Euro advocates.
