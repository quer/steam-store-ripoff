Your goal is to optimize each initial layout to beat the target score, and to compete on the leaderboards, or against your personal best score. Progress through each level involves combining three types of particles with each other to ultimately create void. By manipulating the void optimally, you can achieve your goal of meeting or exceeding the target score specified for each particular level, indicating your mastery of that level. For extra challenge, attempt to reach the target score without any particle interaction with the void. You'll need to create your particles and voids at the right times and in the right places to reach your goal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li>Steam features:<br>Steam Cloud support<br>Big Picture mode: the UI is designed to be easy to see and operate<br>Leaderboards (with game playback), Achievements, Trading cards, and Stats<br><br>    </li><li>Full controller support, or play with keyboard or mouse:<br>You can switch input devices automatically, without needing to access a menu.<br><br>    </li><li>Levels handcrafted by humans:<br>Every campaign level is guaranteed playable to 3 stars.<br>  <br>    </li><li>Daily levels:<br>These levels refresh their initial layouts every 24 hours.
