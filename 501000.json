Outside of Asia, the potential of visual novels, to this day, remains largely untapped. The recent success of the Kickstarter campaign of Afterthought Studios’ A More Beautiful World gives me hope as it sees to combine aspects from both sides of the prime meridian.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://haogamers.com/blog/2016/01/01/a-more-beautiful-world-the-story-of-an-everlasting-journey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Haogamers</a><br><br>“Afterthought Studios has the beginnings of a great game in their hands and it is exciting to see where they will move Violetta as the game moves forward, especially when it comes to friendship or romance! If you’re into complex stories that focus on individuals but on relationships and worlds as well or if you enjoy magical, traveling story lines like those inSpice and Wolf or Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, please consider checking out the lovely demo!”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://hayurika.wordpress.com/2015/12/15/a-more-beautiful-world-demo-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hayurika</a><br><br>“This game’s strong point is the team that’s working on it.  Browse through the Kickstarter and you can easily see that there’s a lot of talented people collaborating on this.  I think that says a lot for the final product.  Though it’s a little outside my usual realm of games that I play (otome games are life), I did enjoy this demo.  There were times when I felt the transitions were somewhat abrupt, but the concept and ideas carry through.  I’m interested in seeing how things work out for the Merchant, but mostly I want to see how Violetta develops as a character.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://otomesweetheart.tumblr.com/post/134950379610/review-a-more-beautiful-world-demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Otome Sweetheart</a><br>",
