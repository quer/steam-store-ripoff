He fears it is the return of the Dark Lord, <i>“Balazar”</i>.<br><br>Armed with a few coins and a great Mervil sword, you embark on your journey. Throughout the five vibrant worlds you meet Mervils, Wizards, and ghosts of the past that tell stories of the power found within The Great Mervil Book. <br><br>Only a fool-hardy Mervil would set-out on such a forsaken quest to defeat<i>&quot;Balazar the Evil&quot;</i>. Will you be cunning enough to find the pages of the Great Mervil Book and have the power to stop Balazar's imminent attack? The task will not be an easy one! The pages are scattered in the darkest depths of the Mervil Kingdom and <i>&quot;Balazar's&quot;</i> enemies are on the hunt.
