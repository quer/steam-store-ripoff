The size and temperature of the star they orbit, their distance from that star, the type of surface, atmosphere, and liquids present (or not) determine how a planet will look once landed on.

While many planets will be too hot or cold, or without an atmosphere, there are also worlds of liquid methane, ammonia, sulphuric acid and more, that have developed their own unique evolutionary cycles. Each kind of alien plant, tree or animal is pieced together randomly, making for a unique experience for each player.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/502720/extras/Spaceship.png?t=1550416852\" ><br>The Star Explorers universe is not a friendly one though, it can be cruel and indifferent to the struggles of its inhabitants.

Upgrading your space suit will unlock these otherwise impossible worlds to further exploration.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Inventory, Upgrading and Crafting</h2>Exploration will allow the player to discover many things, including tools and resources that will help in further exploration.  Among these are raw materials, weapons, armor upgrades and blueprints that allow you to craft helpful items.  Armor upgrades will increase your space suit's resistance to heat, cold and other environmental hazards. Some weapons allow you to access areas that may be closed off to less experienced adventurers.  <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/502720/extras/Cave.png?t=1550416852\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Caves and Ancient Ruins</h2>Star Explorers may be the first interstellar dungeon crawler.  Traversing the dark, hidden places and caves is necessary to find the resources required to complete the game. Discover the crumbling remains of an ancient culture and learn the secrets of its mysterious people.  In Star Explorers, exploration and investigation are rewarded with special items and locations that many players may never find. If you are someone who likes to look around every corner, then this is the game for you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Generative Design</h2>Almost everything in Star Explorers is produced generatively.  From the locations of stars and nebulae, to the surfaces of planets and their features, every location is different, and every play-through offers unique challenges.  Even the music heard in game is generated in real time, and is based purely on the parameters of the player's environment.  Each planet, cave and other location has a unique sound-track.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/502720/extras/Desert.png?t=1550416852\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shaders and Options</h2>Star Explorers has a number of visual options you may choose from.  Among them is the “Old-School Pixel Shader” which offers a unique, low-resolution experience.  The graphics are not really at pace with newer games, but real-time shadows, bloom and a smoothing shader are also available for those who enjoy a slightly more contemporary feel.  You also have control of your field of view, mouse sensitivity and game/music volume, along with options that may help the game run more smoothly on older hardware. See the manual for full documentation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Future of Star Explorers</h2>After a year of Early Access, Star Explorers has arrived at a point where I feel it matches my original design document.  Fulfilling my promise to have it completed in a year was important to me, but that does not mean I am finished working on it.  I have many other ideas I may choose to add to the game's content.  Chief among these are the following:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Space battles with alien ships<br></li><li> Boarding and exploring alien spaceships<br></li><li> More variety of celestial objects, like moons, asteroids and more<br></li><li> Alien cities on certain planets<br></li><li> I even have a mechanism for Time Travel (this is really outside of the original idea, but I am intrigued by the possibility of doing this anyway)</li></ul><br>At some point in the future, I may begin work on these new features.
