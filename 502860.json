In addition to increasing armor protection and its enhancing aerodynamic capabilities, its weapons were also upgraded. Designers replaced the two small 7.62 mm ShKAS guns with a single, yet more powerful 12.7 mm UBS machine-gun. To allow for a better rear view, its dorsal spine was lowered and a new teardrop-style canopy was installed. This version of the Yak-1 was still in production as late as mid-1944 when it was finally replaced by more advanced Yak-3.
