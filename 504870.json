Let me spell it out for you: This is as of yet by far their best module - from the awesome puzzles (that should stupefy no player, but be fun and come with DM-aids to help stuck players) to the iconic dungeon and sense of ancientness, I can find no weakness in the narrative or the module's overall presentation. In fact, I was positively blown away by how neat and concise the narrative is presented.&quot;”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.paizo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Paizo</a><br>",
