This Special Edition has these game modes still in place, because it remains just as funny now as it was then to show the President and the failed candidate what you think… By MOWING THEM DOWN IN A VIDEOGAME! Not just once, but over and over again... Impale a horrified Hillary on the end of your mighty rod! Repulsificate demented Donalds straight to frigging CHINA! It’s hours of FUN for the whole FAMILY!<br><br>Carmageddon: Max Damage for PC features these 3 additional game modes:<br><strong>Trumped-Up</strong> where every pedestrian is respectfully replaced by the President of the United States.<br><strong>Hillaryious</strong> in which you’ll meet nothing but duplicates of the defeated Democratic candidate.<br><strong>Mass Debate</strong> which features a politically correct balance of both characters.<br><br>Animals remain in the mix too – suitably accessorised… You haven’t lived till you’ve knocked the wig off of a penguin!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Carmageddon: Max Damage is the latest instalment in the legendary Carmageddon series.

You can relive all the mangling mayhem with the built-in Action Replay System. Featuring multiple choice of cameras and replay options – it’ll mean you never miss a pile-up again!
