Lily enters her grandfather’s footsteps as a young  archeologist. Her epic quest for the ultimate treasure, fame and glory begins in a small town, below the garden of their own house. “Lily´s Epic Quest” is an innovative enhancement to the match-3 genre. Next to known match-3 mechanics, you clear a path for Lily through different ground layers. Removing blocks will make space for Lily´s path towards the center of the earth. Explore eight magical worlds on your search for rare gems and artifacts and find over 200 collectables. Some of the gems and artifacts are common and others are very rare. It is up to you to collect them all. The game offers traditional match3 principles but with a free roaming playfield. The player decides where to dig for gems or how to solve 115 puzzles. Additional tools will offer more options and provide access to new parts of the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Match 3 with free roaming playfield!\t<br></li><li>Explore eight beautiful magical worlds and 115 puzzles\t<br></li><li>More than 200 treasures and helpful items\t<br></li><li>Hidden doors and powerful tools such as power-drills and dynamite\t<br></li><li>Exciting minigames included</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/507270/extras/Desktop-screens4.jpg?t=1539249277\" >",
