You can find food and water in enemy camps which is sometimes a rarity, as well, it is very risky. The most common way to maintain an appropriate hunger level is by hunting with your trusty rifle. Killing deer will give you in between 1-3 pieces of meat. The difficult part is not exerting too much energy. The more energy you waste by running and firing your rifle will cause increased hunger.
