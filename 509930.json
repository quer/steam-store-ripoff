The stage pickups are placed deliberately and in ways which require experimentation to collect, rather than a linear progression of “Keep moving right.””<br>4.2/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.blotgaming.com/game-reviews/nightmare-nightmarez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >BLOTGAMING</a><br><br>“A little action-platformer that shows a great deal of promise, its fast, frantic and all round pretty damn fun!”<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aB0qI6Tv-M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Smash GaminG!</a><br><br>“NightmareZ is a pretty good time waster.
