The goal is simply collecting all of the relics scattered throughout the world. But, with denizens, cities, and other dragons out to take these same items from you, it's easier said than done.<br><br>The denizens of our world have no hope of standing against you. Your only real threat will be other dragons, which, of course, want the same thing you want and are willing to kill you for it. <br><br>This is a game about playing as a truly terrifying dragon, not lumbering reptiles with wings and one slow/avoidable attack. You should expect to always be on your toes, quickly moving and positioning while using a myriad of attacks. All of these abilities will be made more powerful with leveling and the expansion of your dragon's power.<br><br>Each player is in control of a single dragon which can battle in air or on land. Our combat system is fast paced and involves physical, magical, and ranged combat. As with other similar games, certain combinations of spells and abilities will naturally synergize. Can you find these combinations to maximize your progress, or will you be dominated by the other players?<br><br>What will your reign of terror be like?<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/510370/extras/The-Power-of-Gold.png?t=1497786722\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/510370/extras/Gold.png?t=1497786722\" > All dragons love gold - but the root of this love is more than just fascination - it is the source of all your power. As you collect gold your dragon will increase in power, level, and size.<br><br>This is your most significant resource and is earned by killing denizens and their dwellings. The cities and the travelers between them must be &quot;liberated&quot; of their burden so you can gain power. To best leverage resource acquisition, you will need to prioritize your attacks to maximize your power growth.<br><br>Of course, other dragons also have significant gold you could take... if you can defeat them.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/510370/extras/Improving-Abilities.png?t=1497786722\" ><br>Every player will have four tiers of abilities to choose from for each dragon type, with several abilities in each tier, providing roughly 56 unique dragon abilities at the launch of the game. Only one ability can be chosen per tier, so the possible combinations of play will vary significantly. Once the abilities are chosen, they will only become available at certain levels.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/510370/extras/Collecting-Relics.png?t=1497786722\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/510370/extras/Relic.png?t=1497786722\" > Throughout the world, there are random relics scattered about. These relics are the claim to the throne for the dragon world. Once all relics are returned to a dragon's den, the game is won and the conqueror crowned. But be careful as you collect the relics, since they have a way of drawing in your competition. For every one you possess, you become easier for other players to find you, even from far away places.<br><br>The greatest part about Relics is how they can help you. They aren't just items of &quot;great power&quot; you can never use. Instead, each relic grants a special ability which you can assign to your dragon at any time during the match. Only 4 relics can be selected for activation at a time and will be lost if you die. So, be careful of which relics you choose to keep with you.<br><br>Some boards may have only 5 or 6 relics, while others may contain more than 20. Using the abilities on the &quot;fly&quot; and altering your play style to best leverage your abilities and available relics is the key to winning this game.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/510370/extras/Competing-Dragons.png?t=1497786722\" ><br>Of course, all other dragons are seeking more power as well.
