Collett has been accredited more with the implementation of the locomotives designed and planned by his predecessor than of his own original works. However, Collett made huge improvements on the manufacturing processes, design improvements and standardisation within the GWR. This can perhaps be best appreciated on his design of the coaches of the GWR. His Collett coaches were produced as a follow on of stringent testing and standardisation of the best bogie designs, to ensure the carriages offered the best in ride and comfort. To replace ageing &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and &quot;Concertina&quot; express coaches, mainly 70ft, Collett set about a new design of smaller windowed, shorter coaches generally known as High Waisters. These were produced in various diagrams and proved to be succesful, apart from rather dark interiors, due to dark wood and the small windows. Collett would later modify the designs to bring about the Large Window Colletts to improve lighting. The &quot;Excursion&quot; diagrams were nicknamed &quot;Sunshine&quot; stock due to these improvements.<br><br>GWR High Waist Collett Coaches Pack 03 for TS Marketplace includes the following coach types in GWR Chocolate and Cream, BR Crimson and Cream, BR Chocolate and Cream and BR Maroon livery:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Restaurant Open First<br></li><li>Restaurant Open Third<br></li><li>Full Brake</li></ul>",
