She remained there for a full 12 years before being rescued and was first returned to steam at Didcot Railway Centre in 1990 with main line certification follow soon thereafter. In the late 1990s Nunney Castle underwent another overhaul that saw the fitting of air brake equipment and changes to her tender to increase water capacity.<br><br>2012 saw Nunney Castle back in the engine shed for an intermediate overhaul to her 'bottom end' - the wheels, frames and motion - before enjoying a two-year stint back on the main line.
