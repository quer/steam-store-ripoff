Pick up a data pack at Altair, and deliver it to Zellman Orbital Station at Alpha Vulpeculae, just 50 short light years outside the bubble. But after you docked, you knew something was just... wrong here. Maybe it was the sick red glow of the giant red star hanging in the distance. Or maybe it was the bizarre readings eminating from the stellar fragment swirling below. Even stranger, the station looks like it has been almost entirely abandoned. The few remaining lab techs here - sullen, strange, wild-eyed creatures - stunned you, took your data, and then took you prisoner. When you woke up, you found yourself trapped, alone, in a holding cell. Outside, you gaze into a laboratory of horrors. You don't know what they're doing here, and you don't care to find out. Escape the Lab. Find your Ship. Escape the Station. Don't look back. Because this place has an awful feeling to it...",
