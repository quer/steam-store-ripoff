While the game, game-play, &amp; mechanics are largely completed; it is our hope that we can expand 1) awareness, 2) add a few features, &amp; 3) expand to a few other platforms to reach a wider audience!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Rescue Bear Operation is: a one-level, all ages, child friendly, free to play, mini game designed to create awareness about wildfires. We'll be donating at least 30% of our net proceeds to charitable causes. \r\n\r\nThis game is intentionally kept simple and accessible. There are two objectives.  One: save as many friendly critters as you can! Two: save as many trees by putting out the wild fires! By doing this you will accumulate acorns that can be used as in-game currency to purchase unique cosmetic items in the game. (E.g. hats, shirts, etc) Or; if you want to help good causes in giving back to real world charities and organizations for the victims of wildfires; we also offer unique downloadable content (DLC) that can be purchased with real world currency as well. The option is yours!\r\n\r\nMost of all, please have fun playing the game!\r\n\r\nThank you!",
