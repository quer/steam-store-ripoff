Everyone will be able to visit the alien planet Speculo on <strong>Thursday, October 27th 2016</strong> and find the truth behind the disappearance of its inhabitants.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUT WAIT!

You have to make an emergency landing on the nearby planet. Your goal there is simple: find enough fuel to escape. This straightforward task gets complicated when you realize that all of the planet’s citizens had disappeared in mysterious circumstances. <br><br>Alice VR is a fresh take on the classic adventures of Alice in Wonderland. During your playthrough you'll meet familiar characters such as Cheshire Cat or Mad Hatter, but the unique sci-fi setting will make every encounter a big surprise.<br><br>Will you discover the planet's secret? Are you ready to face the challenges ahead?
