It’s your job to show them how to fulfil the Cleopatra’s wishes; keep on sending more of the little fellas until they do. Alternatively just smite them down with fire and lightning! It’s your management style, so your choice! The fate of the workers, their antics and even avoiding the clutches of Sobek the Crocodile God are all there to make us laugh.<br><br>Cleo’s Lost Idols has a deeply ingrained video mechanic, <strong>enabling you to make, edit, share and watch gameplay videos, right within the game</strong>; no video expertise required! Upload your videos to YouTube, get them liked, and watch yourself climb the rankings in the game’s video leaderboard. Enjoy other people’s clips too.
