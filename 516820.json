The symbiotic force is trying to take control, but you may find a way to control the beast on the confederation laboratories Resist the infection and blaze through various locations to reach the last escape pod before you lose what’s left of your humanity.<br><br>Features<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>Fast Paced First Person Shooter</u><br>Tired of slug-like FPS protagonists?
