This makes it very easy to accurately recreate real world players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Extensive Career Mode for both sexes</h2>In career mode hundreds of teams competing at dozens of tournaments all around the planet are simulated.<br>You start out as local underdog in one of 30 nations. After gaining enough points at national tournaments you are qualified to take part in continental tournaments and eventually you become eligible for international tournaments.<br>After each tournament you can train your team to eradicate your most annoying weaknesses.<br>Before a match starts you can view the abilities of your opposing team.
