The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics. Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes, vast desert plains: the melancholic, dystopian atmosphere of a semi abandoned Earth is the background for the most high-speed, tense and beautiful futuristic racing clashes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>What you can do in the Demo</u></strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Try any of our class 2 ships!<br></li><li>Race in the middle of Cairo's sandstorms!</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>Features</u></strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Online multiplayer - match against 12 players around the world for a real challenge<br></li><li>Optional VR Support - Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or OSVR.
