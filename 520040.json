You'll stimulate tree growth, choose a hue from the sky's breathtaking aurora display to customize your tranquil setting, and navigate the splendor of a lush forest floor—giving colorful life to the dark and sparse landscape. The soothing soundtrack, created by composer Susumu Yokota, evolves with your every interaction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLUMEN was created in collaboration with Walter Greenleaf, PhD, of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, and Framestore's VR Studio—and Dr. Greenleaf and other Stanford research scientists at the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital will be evaluating how LUMEN can help children who are undergoing difficult surgical procedures. The experience is just the tip of the interactive iceberg when it comes to the power of harnessing VR to better your life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n To exit LUMEN, look down until a panel of three buttons appears, then select the X by directing the gaze dot onto it.",
