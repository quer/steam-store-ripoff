            "detailed_description": "Underworld Dungeon is a rogue-like action-adventure, in which you explore a ruined Greek dungeon hidden within the depths of the Underworld. As you dig deeper, ancient weapons and armor will be uncovered which you can combine to create more powerful gear. You will need all the items you can scavenge and craft to conquer this challenging dungeon; a dungeon that masks unspeakable horrors, mythical secrets and finally, the promise of a lost soul, which awaits you at the end of it all.<br><br>Inspired by games such as The Binding of Isaac, Dark Souls and Terraria, Underworld Dungeon aims to create a dark, procedurally generated world filled with item crafting, dungeon looting, many secrets and items to discover, as well as a challenging combat system which would require the player to use their wits and skills to confront each enemy and situation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Features: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">    <li> Over 100 weapons, armour pieces and gear<br>    </li><li> Multiple brutal bosses for you to face on your journey<br>    </li><li> A semi-permament death system, allowing for new items to be unlocked for future playthroughs<br>    </li><li> A fully fledged crafting system, allowing for the most devastating of weapons<br>    </li><li> Full Steamworks support, with Achievements and Leaderboards included<br>    </li><li> Many secrets and NPC's to be discovered inside the dungeon<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Gameplay:\t</h2><br>Combat in Underworld Dungeon will be challenging.
