People of many different races came stumbling out of the darkness into these camps, grateful for the protection.<br><br>Now, hundreds of years later, the 6 camps are giant, cramped cities, heated and lit by magic. Two cities are underground and one is build on the inside edges of a chasm. The cities are now connected by enclosed roads called Archways and travel is now much safer.<br><br>A few years ago explorers came upon orange crystals in an old crater.
