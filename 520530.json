Everyone needs to get/collect the weapons, armors, batteries which are spawned randomly during the process of game. <br />\r\nThere is just one aim - to survive in capsule but everyone can have their own strategy to achieve this. <br />\r\nThere is no inventory in the game. The character needs to carry everything. It is allowed to put on two primary weapons (rifles, guns, shotguns) and two secondary weapons (pistols). The other weapon can be put on only if you replace the one that you already have on yourself. Bullets and medical kits do not have weight and can be added to inventory in any quantity.",
