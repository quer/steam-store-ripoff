It was a simple start that provided the impetus for the brothers to begin exploring down an evolving path that led to increasingly detailed worlds. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis book holds a representative collection of the visuals along that path - a journey from one world to another - demonstrating the creative attention to detail that Cyan is known for.
