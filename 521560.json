Obsesses over finding a link between science and mysticism but only ever seems to be proving a link between alcohol and bad decisions. Plays guitar, synthesizers and supplies baritone vocals. Prefers to do anything but actual, tangible work, proclaims he was born with a rare disease called 'Cannotbearseditus'.<br><br><br><strong>Frithel</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/521560/extras/frithel.png?t=1579766124\" ><br>If Frithel could change every choice to include the suffix 'or science?' he would always choose the latter. This man is obsessed with science - he lives, breathes, digests and inserts science. He carasses, high fives and smooches science, he... okay you get the picture. Also plays Drums, loves the Bee Gees and spoken word poetry... in a sciencey kind of way.<br><br><br><strong>Auto</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/521560/extras/auto.png?t=1579766124\" ><br>Auto is short for Automaton, and is the groups robotic aid and protector. Over time he has developed a fondness for Carlton, due to the time that Mr. Breezy has invested in playing with Auto. From darts, to movies, to arcade machines and to the definite chagrin of the other chaps, as this reduces the time that Auto could be tidying, computing and generally busying himself around the ship in a non-creepy android going-to-kill-all-humans way.<br><br><br><strong>Chladni</strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/521560/extras/chladni.png?t=1579766124\" ><br>Chladni is in charge of sub 400hz vibrations and is a celebrated player of the Low Frequency Guitar.
