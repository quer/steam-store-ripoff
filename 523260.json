SteamHammerVR is a trademark of Showstorm Ltd <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCarefully read and follow the Safety and Regulatory Guide provided with your HTC Vive before installing and using this software. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA portion of the Safety and Regulatory Guide, available from HTC's support web site, is reprinted below to provide you with an example of some of the safety procedures recommended by HTC. This is not the complete guide, you should read all of the guide from HTC. Please consult HTC's web site for the very latest information. As stated in the HTC Safety and Regulatory Guide, provided with your HTC Vive: <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnsure the Area Around You is Safe for Use of the Product <br />\r\nWhile wearing the product’s headset you are blind to the world around you. The image displayed in the headset <br />\r\nwill not match the real world. Always use the product in a clear and safe area. Do not rely on the product’s <br />\r\nchaperone system for protection. Do not use near stairways, large windows, heat sources, or outdoors. Clear the <br />\r\nplay area of people, furniture, and other things that may be obstacles or block you from freely moving around. <br />\r\nFor example, if a pet comes into the room while you are using the product, you likely will not be aware of the <br />\r\npet’s presence and you could trip over your pet while moving in the virtual reality environment. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is recommended that the product be used only while under the supervision of another person who is ready to <br />\r\nwarn of hazards that may arise while the product is being used. Examples of hazards that could arise include, but <br />\r\nare not limited to, tangling of a cable in a manner that presents a tripping hazard, pets entering the area where <br />\r\nthe product is being used, and the user walking too close to a wall or another hazard). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe Aware of the Cable and Connections <br />\r\nKeep in mind the location of the cable and connections running from the headset so that you are not likely <br />\r\nto trip over or pull on them while moving around or walking around the play area. Move your feet slowly and <br />\r\ncarefully to avoid tripping, including on the cable. Make sure to maintain good footing. Tripping over the cable <br />\r\nor contacting obstacles could cause injury or damage. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake Care of the Controllers <br />\r\nWhile using the hand controllers, always check that you have sufficient overhead and surrounding clearance <br />\r\nto allow you to fully extend your arms outward and upwards. Hitting persons or objects may cause injury or <br />\r\ndamage. Hold the controllers firmly and always use the wrist straps. If released while using, the controller may <br />\r\ncause injury or damage.",
