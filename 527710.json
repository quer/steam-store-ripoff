His former marshall Ademar has seized the crown, while much of the realm has returned to the days of squabbling petty kingdoms.<br><br>In chaotic times such as these, it is possible for even a lowly commoner to rise high in the world.<br><br>The people cry out for blood and entertainment. The brutal games of the arena provide both in equal measure. Now is your chance to establish a house and train a worthy team of fighting slaves who might someday compete in the grandest of all arenas.<br><br>Their glory will be your glory. Before the sun sets on this once-mighty empire, there is still time to carve out a legacy in blood and steel ...</i><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/527710/extras/ScribeMapSmall.png?t=1549425572\" ></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>From the creators of <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/420740/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >The Deed</a>, <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/460960/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >The Deed: Dynasty</a> and the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/877/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Space Pilgrim Saga</a> comes a fantasy RPG/Management simulator set in the ruthless world of gladiatorial combat.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/527710/extras/Slaves.png?t=1549425572\" ><br><br>In <i><strong>Crown Champion: Legends of the Arena</strong></i> you are not a hero, a noble ruler, or even a combatant.
