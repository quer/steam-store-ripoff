            "detailed_description": "<h1>FAQ</h1><p><ul class=\"bb_ul\">   <li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What games are similar to Arakion?</h2> The core of Arakion is based on Blobber RPGs. With that said, Arakion takes inspiration from many games including Might and Magic, Dark Cloud 2, Dungeon Master and many more to create a truly unique experience.<br>   </li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What Languages Does Arakion Support?</h2>Arakion officially supports only English. However, you can access Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Italian, Dutch, Spanish, French and German in various states of translation. Almost all text will be Translated while some will be manually translated and some machine translated.<br>   </li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Is Arakion turn-based or real-time?</h2> Arakion will launch with only real-time combat. However, the Arakion engine supports both - implementing turn-based combat as an option is a high priority for after-launch.<br>   </li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How many people are developing Arakion?</h2> Arakion is primarily developed by one person.<br>   </li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Arakion has been in development for a while, what took so long?</h2> I chose to take the time to develop a quality product and engine as opposed to rushing Arakion to market. I was either going to do it right or not do it at all. Players deserve a quality game, no matter how much time it takes.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Enter the world of Arakion, a grid-based role-playing dungeon crawler that pays homage to classics while adding its own style with fresh mechanics. Lead a band of three heroes through a broken land, ripped apart by unknown forces. Explore a beautiful handcrafted world filled with crumbling dungeons, dense forests, ancient temples, and hidden secrets, all while attempting to build a safe-haven from the chaos.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2>Play as three adventurers awoken in a world torn by conflict, where the lands and rivers have been ripped from the ground. In midst of this upheaval, there is but one desire - finding a place free from the conflict and chaos. In the search for order, your heroes must find a way to stop the destruction from continuing.<br><br>Between your intrepid adventurers and their goal exists a council of immortal beings. They are known as <strong>The Ancients</strong>. The Ancients wandered Arakion since before written history. Their plan is simple - utter annihilation for all who oppose them. <br><br><strong><i>It's time to begin your story, will you be the world's salvation or destruction?</i></strong><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/528980/extras/UltraThinSeperator.png?t=1549419237\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Background</h2>Arakion takes everything that made classic role-playing games like Might &amp; Magic great, then adds an expansive set of new features.

Relive the glory days of role-playing games with this one-of-a-kind experience. Arakion is a beautiful world where you will get lost in adventure and exploration.<br><br>The creators of Arakion have been inspired by a multitude of games - everything from <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> to <strong>Dark Cloud 2</strong>.
