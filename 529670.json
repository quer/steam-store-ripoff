You don't pick them; they pick you.&quot; -- John Irving<br><br>The Bellows has recently been reworked from the ground up. Taking the knowledge gleaned from the previous release, Castle Steps has created a polished horror experience designed to show people just how scary VR can be. The game has been redone with brand new content, new scares, and a singular focus. Scaring you, scaring your family, and scaring your friends. Plunge yourself into a world of nightmares and fear, and discover just how frightening virtual reality can be. <br><br><br>Included in The Bellows:<br><br>- The Bellows<br>We've completely reworked the original Bellows title. While there are certainly nodds to the old game, almost all the content is brand new and completely revamped. It's shorter, scarier, and all around built to be perfect for showing off virtual horror in both home and arcade settings. The game has been built specifically for HTC Vive, but is also supported on Oculus Rift when being played through SteamVR. The game takes on average about 15 minutes to complete.<br><br>- The Bellows: Omni<br>Identical to the revamped Bellows experience described above, we're proud to say we've partnered with Virtuix to make a version of our newly improved game available for use with the Omni. <br><br>- The Bellows Legacy:<br>This is the game that originally came out Halloween 2016. It has some bugs that we were never able to resolve, but we've decided to include it nonetheless. We feel it would be unfair to remove a product people have paid for, although we recognize it has issues that render it a very flawed product on its own. It only plays on Vive, and there are no plans to update it. We hope you enjoy it, but please understand going in that there may be consistent crashes on some hardware.<br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://springboardvr.com?game_verification=3e541040-0acd-11e8-ad28-6701ab1ab56e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  > Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR </a>",
