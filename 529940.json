The goal is very simple: score the largest amount of points possible in the time given to you. By dodging plasma projectiles you gain points and combos to earn action points. These can be used for the following perks: teleporting, attack, multi-attack, slowing down time. By killing your foes you gain additional time, which enables you to score more points. Enemies can be killed by your projectiles or can get run over by a ship that you can control at any time, even when you're not on it. They can also get knocked out and drown when hit by a larger wave. When you get hit, you don't gain a point and your combo progress decreases. This makes it harder to gain action points that enable the use of player's abilities - which in return enable player to gain more points.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Showdown: Virtual reality carnage</h2>Every copy of the game comes bundled with an accompanying piece of work in a form of a book &quot;<a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M076VQN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Showdown: Virtual reality carnage</a>&quot;.
