            "detailed_description": "<h1>Developer FAQ</h1><p><strong>Greetings fellow Extractors! </strong><br><br>We've seen some questions popping up about ROM: Extraction and we here at First Contact Entertainment want to answer them directly. We've selected some of the top questions we've seen but if there's anything else you want to ask us, hit us up on  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/firstcontact3nt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/firstcontactent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Facebook</a> or visit our website <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://firstcontactent.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >firstcontactent.com</a> to connect with us!<br><br><strong>Q:</strong> Is this just another wave shooter?<br><br><strong>A: </strong>ROM: Extraction is a game that is not meant to end. We were so excited with what we created that we wanted to get it into the hands of eager VR players quickly. This meant launching the game with our first mode styled as an homage to the classic arcade shooter as the first step into a larger universe. We're hoping players love and enjoy the action-packed gameplay and arcade style as much as we do! Our ultimate goal though is to constantly expand the game by adding new maps, modes, multi-player, and more - plus, we'll be sharing as much info as possible with players when new maps and modes become available. <br><br><strong>Q:</strong> Does the game really only have one map?<br><br><strong>A: </strong>The base game only contains one map; We will be releasing more maps and content over the coming months. We encourage everyone to master the core mechanics, compete on the worldwide leaderboard and establish dominance now because when multi-player comes out, it'll be a totally different experience!<br><br><strong>Q: </strong>Will there ever be more guns or weapons?<br><br><strong>A: </strong>The quick and short answer is YES. More guns, more fun.<br><br><strong>Q: </strong>How much will the content updates cost?<br><br><strong>A: </strong>ROM: Extraction will have multiple types of content updates but one of the most unique things we're doing is we'll be offering up FREE content too, such as new maps, weapons, and challenge modes. We're also looking into getting our community involved in unique ways so they can help shape the content being released in ROM. <br><br><strong>Q: </strong>Will you charge me for multi-player?<br><br><strong>A:</strong> Multi-player will be a FREE content update when it is released. <br><br><strong>Q: </strong>What new modes/content will be coming to the game?<br><br><strong>A:</strong> We can't give away all our secrets, Extractor! We can confirm right now though  that a new map and multi-player are considered our top priority of content that's coming soon (VERY SOON) to ROM.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>ROM: Extraction is a fast-paced homage to the classic arcade shooter, featuring an unprecedented style of VR gameplay.</strong><br><br>Welcome to the year 2076, where you now have the power to slow down time--called &quot;Reflex&quot; power.

Simple to pick up, not too complex, but addicting and fun like a classic arcade shooter. In ROM: Extraction, this is the secret sauce. My instincts kick in...a smile creeps onto my face as it clicks for me...these explosions are incredible. Before I know it I feel like a mixture between Gambit from X-Men throwing orbs instead of cards and Deadpool, bending and dodging bullets as I mow down my enemies.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://uploadvr.com/rom-extraction-first-contact-call-of-duty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Upload VR</a><br>",
