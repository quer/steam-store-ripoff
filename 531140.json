All the Delicate Duplicates is a must-play....It's a standout game.”<br>Rated &quot;A&quot; – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.defunctgames.com/courant/1121/all-the-delicate-duplicates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >DefunctGames</a><br><br>“I rarely ever play a game twice, especially campaigns or story-driven games. Once they’re done, they’re done in my eyes. However All the Delicate Duplicates wants to smash that...And while your first time might be quick, second time around you’ll likely take your time and soak in what the game has to offer. All the Delicate Duplicates has certainly left a mark. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my time with a game that I could see kick start a new form of storytelling.”<br>9.3 out of 10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.n3rdabl3.co.uk/2017/02/20/167323/all-the-delicate-duplicates-review-again-and-again-and-again/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >N3rdabl3</a><br><br>“The more short games that I play, the more I’m really coming to appreciate little interactive fictions and experiences that can be completed in one sitting. Luminaries of such form might include Journey and Limbo and Firewatch, and it’s safe to count All the Delicate Duplicates amongst such company...All The Delicate Duplicates is refreshing simply because it works the brain in ways that few other games even bother to try. It’s certainly a game that sticks with you.”<br>8.2 out of 10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://fuzzypixels.net/games/reviews/all-the-delicate-duplicates-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Fuzzy Pixels</a><br>",
