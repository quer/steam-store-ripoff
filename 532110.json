And then splurge on the amazing free Cube Escapes, each of which adds to the Rusty Lake universe in a peculiar way. You’ll be so glad you did.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/24/rusty-lake-roots-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>“Rusty Lake: Roots is an excellent follow-up to Rusty Lake Hotel—grander, grimmer, and more gruesome than ever. The Rusty Lake games are quickly carving out a niche as my favorite point-and-click series of the modern era, with a bold confidence underpinning their unconventional and inventive world. I highly recommend picking up the pair for a night or two of surreal horror.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3136358/software/rusty-lake-roots-review-a-grim-sequel-for-one-of-2016s-best-surprises.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PCWorld</a><br><br>“That payoff is the same as any great Rusty Lake game: the ability to lose yourself in the strange and disturbing events unfolding before you. An empathy for and understanding of even characters that don’t speak a word. A frustration and then exhilaration at solving brain-burning puzzles. And an increased appreciation, love, and fear of Rusty Lake and its shadowy, timeless inhabitants. Roots just happens to have all of this in an even larger, longer package; with more lives on the line; and more reasons to book your stay.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2016/11/01/rusty-lake-roots-review-hello-brother/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameZebo</a><br>",
