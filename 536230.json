This was the first step towards a full shift to VR for the studio, and signaled a departure from more conventional products. The UI-heavy game and generally non-cute aesthetic led the team to again shift focus and rework the aesthetic and style to what became Candy Squad. Instead of terminating Siege Hammer, we left it as a playable game for free, knowing that some features don’t entirely work as intended. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you to everyone for your support! Everyone who purchased Siege Hammer will be provided a free copy of VR Toolbox: 360 Desktop and the Forest DLC.",
