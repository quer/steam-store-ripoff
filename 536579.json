            "detailed_description": "A famous name from the 1940s comes to FSX: Steam Edition! The Hawker Hurricane lost out somewhat in the fame stakes to the much more renowned Spitfire, but the reality is that Hurricanes proved more effective than Spitfires in the Battle of Britain. It was a more robust aircraft, and its fabric-over-frame construction meant that it was cheaper and quicker to build and repair than the Spitfire with its monocoque all-metal construction. The prototype first flew on the 6th November, 1935, and the aircraft was steadily improved and altered to eventual production standard. <br><br>Developed by Just Flight, Battle of Britain Hurricane add-on for FSX: Steam Edition includes three versions of this remarkable aircraft, from the Prototype through the early Mk1 two-bladed Rotol propeller version to the Mk1's more refined three-bladed propeller type. With an incredibly detailed cockpit, several model variations, exacting flight dynamics, realistic engine sounds and top quality paint schemes, the Hurricane makes an ideal stablemate for its famous sister, the Supermarine Spitfire (also available in the FSX: Steam Edition store).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tHighly detailed exterior models <br></li><li>\tHigh quality interactive 3D Virtual Cockpit <br></li><li>\tRealistic sounds <br></li><li>\tCanopy jettison feature <br></li><li>\t11 authentic liveries <br></li><li>\tAnimated pilot figure <br></li><li>\tDetailed Merlin engine visible <br></li><li>\tNumerous animations <br></li><li>\tHigh fidelity flight model <br></li><li>\tDetailed manual <br></li><li>\tEngine start and gun effects <br></li><li>\tMultiple viewpoints <br></li><li>\tOpening inspection hatches and a fully detailed exterior cockpit <br></li><li>\tRemovable features include fuel tank cover, inspection panel on starboard side and gun hatches on wing</li></ul><br>Includes Hawker Hurricane  Mk1 'Battle of France' period model with wooden two-bladed propeller, ring-and-bead gun sight, fabric wings as well as Hawker Hurricane Mk1 'Battle of Britain' period model<br><br>Interior models recreating early Hurricane with ring-and-bead gun sight as well as Mk1 production cockpit with reflector gunsight<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tExterior models built following the most accurate plans available, to achieve highly accurate profiles and shapes <br></li><li>\tFeatures modelled fabric over stringer rear fuselage <br></li><li>\tSpecular and bump mapped where appropriate <br></li><li>\tEngine start battery trolley<br></li><li>\tVirtual cockpits completely modelled to portray the real cockpit in full detail <br></li><li>\tEvery switch, knob and lever works, most with bespoke animation code <br></li><li>\tShadow textured where appropriate <br></li><li>\tAnimations include sliding canopy, animated pilot figure, canopy jettison feature, undercarriage, movable radiator flap, retracting foot step and hand grabs, flaps, rudder, elevators, ailerons and trim tabs<br></li><li>\tFuel tank cover can be removed to reveal tank, supply pipes and fittings <br></li><li>\tInspection panel on starboard side can be removed to reveal cockpit detail <br></li><li>\tGun hatches on wing can be removed to reveal Browning machine guns, ammunition feeders and fully modelled shells <br></li><li>\tSpecial effects include engine start smoke effect and gun firing effects and sounds<br></li><li>\tHighly detailed texture mapping without compromising frame rates <br></li><li>\tLayered paint kit included to help create your own liveries (suitable additional paint program such as Photoshop required)</li></ul>",
