The question is, what else awaits?<br><br>Characteristics:<br><strong>•NON-LINEAR PROGRESSION</strong> – COLINA: Legacy was developed in a way as to create uncertainty to what player will find in the house on top of the hill. No gameplay section will be like the previous one regarding the suspense-mechanics implemented in the game.<br><br><strong>•RICH STORY </strong>– The COLINA: Legacy's writing was executed as to convey various layers of complexity. Players can interpret the story that unfolds throughout their gameplay sections in a simple way or analise it and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.<br><br><strong>•THIRD-PERSON GAMEPLAY</strong> – The Samurai Games team opted for bringing a third-person camera for the game to pay homage to the horror games of old, where it reigned supreme.<br><br><strong>•CHALLENGING PUZZLES</strong> – Quest and Game Design thought out the videogame's challenges and puzzles in different ways. The player will experience and understand the different mechanics of gameplay implemented through these challenges.
