Based on the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, where a man storms of the Gates of Hades to return his wife to the land of the living, Dylan traverses infinite worlds of the Multi-verse to find his wife. But with every jump, Dylan is thwarted by the efforts of the mysterious Hooded Man. Ignoring the warnings of his mentor, DR. YAMAMOTO, Dylan recklessly jumps into ever more flawed universes, until the rules of physics completely break down, threatening to destroy the universe and everything in it.",

This film is a total mindbender... It's like Pi and Memento on crack. It starts off a bit slow, but man... DOn't want to give anything away, but defintely watch it all the way through... it's worth it! - Chris Wilkerson”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/paradoxthefilm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Vimeo</a><br><br>“one of the best indie sci-fi movies i've seen in years. it's kind of like a time travel movie but not and kind of like a parallel worlds movie but not quite. neatly weaves together real science and pure science fiction into a totally mind-bending movie. have not heard of this director but am thrilled to have found this movie - there' s a great future for this director! totally worth watching for anyone but especially for sci-fi buffs. 5/5 stars for me! - David Choi”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/paradoxthefilm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Vimeo</a><br>",
