We'll be adding over 100 more in early 2017.<br></li><li> Flashlight app: Turn your tablet into a flashlight.  Control the color and brightness.  It's surprisingly fun.<br></li><li> Sky app: Change the time of day, add fog, add clouds.  </li></ul><br><br>Reason 4: <br><br>We are adding new apps constantly.
