The other player uses a desktop computer/console to become one of the tiny Beings under the watchful eye of the Overseer. Tasked with destroying the Overseer’s energy source, blending in becomes critical. A mis-step, breaking away from the crowd cover of other Beings, or being spotted destroying an energy orb turns the search into a nerve-wracking hunt. Armed with a slow-charging eye laser capable of killing a Being with a single shot, the Overseer will suddenly have the advantage, as the dissident Being attempts to once again hide in plain sight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith an unsettling, science fiction atmosphere that hints at a dark and secretive lore, Panoptic features numerous interactive levels and environments, multiple types of NPC AI, a wondrous sense of scale, and short - but constantly intense - rounds of local 1v1 competition.",
