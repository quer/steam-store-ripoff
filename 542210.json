In the future, we'll introduce the Xemo Robot Builder and robot part kits as paid DLC.  If you purchased the game prior to August 1st, you'll get equivalent credit in DLC when released.</p><br><h1>Evolution Engine Added Sept 2017</h1><p>For release 1.7, we've added the Evolution Chamber, which includes and evolution engine used to evolve your robots behavior. This is still experimental, so play around with it and let us know what you think. We will be adding penalty constraints to the fitness function along with ability to evolve the motion of a subset of robot joints. Lots more to come.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Xemo is a physics-based simulation of a humanoid robot.  Highly detailed graphics and a refined user interface allow you to quickly create new robot motions such as crouching, crawling, jumping, rolling, walking and climbing.  Combine your motions in a control sequence to solve the game's challenging obstacle courses.  Compete against your friends and rivals to move to the top of the leader board for each level.  You are rewarded for sharing motions with the Xemo community, and can continue to improve your robot's performance using better, faster and more efficient motions. How fast and agile is your robot?  Play Xemo and discover just how good you are.<br><br>We just added:  (v1.7 Sept 2017)<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> The Balance Controller redesigned for bipedal robots.<br></li><li> Leader boards - one per level<br></li><li> Evolution engine for evolving complex robot motion behaviors</li></ul><br>This simulation game already includes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Xemo : a robot with 13 joints with a total of 24 DoF (Degrees of freedom)<br></li><li> Sami - a simple 4-legged robot that you teach to crawl, turn, walk, jump andturn over.<br></li><li> Buster - a more complex 4-legged robot that can walk something like an ant.<br></li><li> Fido - the dog-like robot that has hip and knee joints - a greater challenge!<br></li><li> Integrated rigid-body physics simulation<br></li><li> The Robot Lab where you create new robot motions<br></li><li> The Pattern Editor, which you use to creation motions for your robot.<br></li><li> The Game Levels (16) where you compete with your robot<br></li><li> The Gravity Well, to suspend and position the robot in mid-air<br></li><li> The Joint Editor, used to adjust the robots ankle, knee, hip, abs, shoulder, elbow and neck joints<br></li><li> The Spring Editor, used to set the speed and strength of each joint<br></li><li> Environment and machine sound effects</li></ul><br>Early Access<br>Come and join us to help shape the future of Xemo!
