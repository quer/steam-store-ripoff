There are several types of missions. 8 packs with 30 levels in each pack. 240 levels overall. We plan to add more level packs into the game with new exciting mechanics!<br><br>Below you may see a lot of reviews from youtubers who we gave keys to play our game. And you may think - &quot;can I trust them?&quot; So let us tell about it. We never ask youtubers to be nice. They decide what to do by themselves. Some of them even show our email text in their videos(why?). So everything very open here. Often we get answers like - &quot;OK I can try your game, but I warn you, I will give only honest opinion and if I don't like something then I will tell so. If it's OK with you then send me key&quot;. And yes that is totally OK for us.
