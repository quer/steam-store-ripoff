Your early access purchase now is covering the next 5 months of gameplay until we expect to leave early access.</p><br><h1>LEARNING CONTENT</h1><p>Our educational content was designed around all middle school and some high school Next Generation Science Standards for ecology.  We will keep growing the content and have more advanced science and other content as we build, but want to be clear that if you are an adult that remembers all your science from school, you may not learn much <i>new</i> in the current game.  If this is something you want to make sure is supported and built out to reach its potential anyway, we’d appreciate your support and feedback as we develop!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><i>We are still in development. Please read the Early Access description above before purchasing. Thank you!</i><br><br>Tyto Online is a MMORPG where you play as an evacuee from the now uninhabitable Earth. You’re settling on the planet Ovo to study at Tyto Academy as you establish your new life. Explore and complete quests while learning real science concepts. These are designed to be appropriate for 9 years old and up.<br><br>Right now, we have mainly content around Ecology (aligned with middle and high school science standards), including a create-your-own ecosystem Sandbox. We are beginning to add Heredity content beginning on June 5th.
