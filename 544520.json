While being severely limited in many aspects by the fact that you're imprisoned in half a pound of cotton and felt made into the vague likeness of a human being, you are otherwise granted the Hogwarts worthy ability to transfer your soul into the bodies of other puppets around you. A skill that, if used well, just might save your life. <br><br>An exhaustive amount of meticulous planning and perfectly timed executions are vital in the survival of the game. Carefully take note of your surroundings, and you might even outsmart the puppet master and get your body back.

Our goal is to work towards expanding our knowledge of the tools, techniques, and processes used in video game development.",
