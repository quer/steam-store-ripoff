            "short_description": "Guide Alice, cat astronaut extraordinaire, to the top of the building without being caught by the vicious Space Mice. The original version of this vertically-scrolling maze game was released in September 1981 for the PC-8001. It was designed by Takanari Suzuki, Japan’s first star game creator.",

            "reviews": "“Even though it was developed on very primitive hardware, Space Mouse is still a remarkable achievement in game design. The challenge isn't just in having quick reflexes, but also in planning ahead, reading situations, and knowing when to move. It's a uniquely rewarding jolt of arcade action, and the effective presentation lends everything the right amount of charm. This is a fine blast from the past that'll satisfy anyone with an open mind.”<br>7/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.cubed3.com/review/3278/1/space-mouse-35th-anniversary-edition-pc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Cubed3</a><br>",
