If anyone gets close enough to get a decent sniff, they’ll contract one of Nurgle’s nasty diseases and usually die before anyone can suggest a new personal hygiene regime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs with most Chaos teams, the Nurgle team is at its best when it can get stuck in and directly take on opposing players. What it has in strength and toughness, the Nurgle team lacks in agility. Nurgle Warriors have a lousy Agility value and Move rate, and do not make good ball bearers.
