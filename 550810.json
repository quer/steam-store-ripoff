            "reviews": "“For the price Abduction Bit is a fun little title that takes us back to the arcade era of the 80s and does its uttermost best to ensure a most authentic and historical correct experience. Next to the rather retro-looking 8-bit graphics, the available sound effects will surely help you get that feeling. The game comes with free DLC and the various map modes gives a lengthy playtime or a nice short break time waster.”<br>8.0 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://3rd-strike.com/abduction-bit-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >3rd Strike</a><br><br>“Abduction Bit è un piacevolissimo trip nel passato che di sicuro farà la gioia dei giocatori più agé grazie a un'ottima resa della piacevole follia degli albori videoludici.”<br>75% – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.truegamers.it/abduction-bit-recensione/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >TrueGamers</a><br>",
