You will guide him through his graduating mission to become a fully fledged hero by rescuing Sam, an Anthro American Fox girl stuck on the barren Earth 333666.  Besides surviving the elements, an old evil from both the PRT and Farm universes is after Ray and Sam, the multiversal dictator Forte.  Will he win the day?  Or will Ray and Sam save us all?  Do your best to SURVIVE.<br><br><strong>Metabolic Mechanics!</strong><br>Watch your caloric intake and fluid consumption, as proper resource management is the key to survival.  Will you push Ray’s body to the limit to escape as quickly as possible?  Or will your methodical scouring give you enough to survive?<br><strong>An escort mission with heart!</strong><br>As your constant companion, Sam will learn and grow with you, or stagnate and barely be concerned about your well being.  A hero is more than someone that just throws punches, can you help repair her scorched soul?<br><strong>A story 14 years in the making! (And counting!)</strong><br>Learn the rich lore of both the PRT and Farm universes, as not everything is as it seems.  Is this war of light and dark truly inevitable?  Or is there finally a road to peace?  Your actions will decide their fates!<br><br><i>A Message From Richard Wolf:</i><br>This is Part 1 of a planned 3 part series that will be the end of the PRT/Farm storylines.  Should this game flop, the other two parts will be canceled and the rest of the story lost to time.  But should things go according to plan, the other two parts will be made as DLC, and the stories found earlier in the timeline will be made over time, a true series with more games and media than you could imagine.  This is my love letter to the multiverse, and I don't want the story to end here.  But I am no longer in a position where I can choose between my passions and profits.  If both don't come together, profits will unfortunately win the day.  No guilt, just truth.  I wish you well, and I'll(hopefully) see you in the multiverse.",
