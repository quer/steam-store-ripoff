For something that's just launched in Early Access it's remarkably well realised, and I look forward to seeing how shipshape it is once the voyage to completion is finally done.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-02-22-abandon-ship-takes-the-ftl-formula-to-the-seas-with-great-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Eurogamer</a><br><br>“I quickly became a fan of the oil painting design direction of Abandon Ship and felt that it made the game stand out when compared to titles in the same genre, but the combat is where I feel Fireblade has found a nice balance of deep tactics through simple execution.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.dualshockers.com/abandon-ship-preview-pc-steam-early-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >DualSHOCKERS</a><br><br>“In the end though, what we see is a title that already shows more chops than a lot of titles that are full releases.
