But if you adopt one, you'll soon find out how little this pawed predator has in common with a rodent. As cuddly as they come, it'll lick your face, and you'll discover that no, Ratchams are not completely lacking in hair.

Favourite area: the island of Pandala.<br><br>- PSYCHOTIC EMOTE:<br>Not many have succeeded in awakening the power of the Psychotic mask. Surrounded by a blood-red aura, it lets you create a gigantic and terrifying horned spectral mask! In only a couple of seconds, an uncontrollable fear will take hold of your enemies! And according to Yen Adertal, the first Masqueraider, just as few have succeeding in activating the Psychotic Emote!<br><br>- STEAMER HAVEN-BAG:<br>This item contains the STEAMER Haven Bag theme and all its decorative elements.
