She had a choice, to flee or to turn on her tormentors. Her last deed drove her into darkness.<br><br><strong>From Dust to Dust</strong><br>Source of The Hag's power, a blackened finger used as a catalyst to her terrible power: the Phantasm Traps. The Hag draws in the soil to set a trap for the survivors. When a survivor finds her trap, a lifelike illusion of the killer appears in front of them. Once the trap is triggered, The Hag has a choice. To enter the physical illusion when the survivors are within her reach or use it as a decoy to take down her unsuspecting prey before the phantasm collapses into pieces of dirt and mud.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/554381/extras/DBD_OfFleshAndMud_Content_3.jpg?t=1533215501\" ><br><br><strong>Killer Perks</strong><br>The Hag perks revolve around a new gameplay mechanic: the Hex totems. They are focused on cursing the survivors and sapping their abilities.<br><br><strong>Ruin</strong><br>An ominous hex that affects the survivors' skills at repairing generators. Survivors affected by Ruin suffer the following in their desperate fight for survival:<br>Good Skill checks results in regression on the generator.<br>Great Skill checks do not grant bonus progression on the generator.<br><br><strong>Devour Hope</strong><br>A hex rooting its power on hope. The false hope of survivors ignites your hunger. When a survivor is rescued from a hook at least 24 meters away, Devour Hope receives a token. Tokens grant various abilities such as double damage and kill by your own hand.<br><br><strong>The Third Seal</strong><br>You will curse a survivor by hitting the victim while the Hex Totem is active. The hex reduces the effectiveness of the victim's aura reading ability and make the survivor easy prey. But only one survivor can have this curse at a time. Once you hit another survivor, the Hex is transferred to your next victim.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/554381/extras/DBD_OfFleshAndMud_Content_4.jpg?t=1533215501\" ><br><br><strong>Are you feeling lucky?</strong><br>Ace Visconti is one charming guy. From his roots as a poor boy in Argentina, he gamed, scammed, seduced and smooth-talked his way to a life of luxury as a high roller in the land of opportunity.
