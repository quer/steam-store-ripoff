Ax murderers, mad scientists and tax evaders, all kinds of bad guys consider this place to be their sweet home. This is the perfect place to rest, relax, and pursue a career in the noblest of professions: professional Villain!!<br><br>The real estate agent promised you a haunted house with jump scare devices and terrifying traps. Instead, you have a piece of empty land full of Vermin near a rubbish forest.<br><br>But do not flee yet! With a little elbow grease, the help of your minions and a lot of murders, you can turn this house into a happy and dreary mortal trap. Just lure locals inside, then trigger your deadly traps or let your minion feast on their brains and flesh. Every night you'll multiply your evil level until everyone calls your mansion &quot; scary, nasty and horrible.&quot;<br><br>Be aware that the League of MachiaVillain Villains has adopted a strict policy that governs the level of wickedness that you have to adhere to in order to stay in the community. Drs Frank and Stein, Siamese co-Chairmen of the Board of evil ( BDM ), dictated a series of rules to follow when conducting your villainous business. They cover everything from how to kill intruders- to what salads are considered the most evil (no surprise, grated carrots).<br><br>Follow the rules of the League and become the scariest neighborhood Villain!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/555510/extras/SteamFeatures_.png?t=1548701763\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Build your mansion:</strong> Create the evil mansion of your nightmares!

They also have different fighting styles, such as long range, bare handed, and of course, bare fanged.<br></li><li><strong>Manage your monsters:</strong> No evil mansion is complete without a cadre of minions to keep it running.

Why not use those bits and bobs to craft something useful? MachiaVillain lets you create things using ingredients gathered from victims and harvested from the environment.
