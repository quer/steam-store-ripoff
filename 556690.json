A mother’s love is undying, but so too is her hate. In her eyes, you are murderers, and she will gather dark sisters from far abroad to draw you into a mystic nightmare from which there will be no escape!<br><br>This adventure for characters of 6th to 7th level supplements the epic journey through the northern wilds of the Far East Adventure Path campaign. It allows GMs to show the dynamic nature of the campaign world as forces they thought defeated turn out to have allies that do not take the defeat of their kin lightly. While easiest to include as part of the journey through the mountains of the subpolar north as their caravan approaches the arctic, scaling notes suggest methods for leveling up the adventure for use after the arctic crossing as the PCs’ caravan descends into the Eastern Realms. Apart from an Adventure Path, this adventure can be easily dropped into any campaign to infuse it with an air of malevolent witchery.<br><br>The Way of Ki. The power of ki lies latent within all things, flowing through mind, body, and spirit alike and able to be seen and harnessed by those with the focus, devotion, and dedication to master themselves and achieve perfect unity and balance. The game describes ki only in terms of the mystic powers manifested by the monk and ninja, and The Way of Ki contains a wealth of options for increasing the variety and flavor of what these classes can do through their mastery of meditative practice and transcendental contemplation. The power of ki, however, is universal, available to anyone with the focus, desire, and discipline to master it, and The Way of Ki allows characters of every class to unleash this power, adding it to or infusing it within their normal class abilities. Unlock the great mysteries and transcend the natural into the sublime. The game touches on these secrets only briefly, in the context of the mystic powers manifested by the monk and ninja.

For masters of the mystic arts, there are 16 magical feats including Graceful Calm, Perfected Creation, and Unbounded Conversion. Besides these 59 feats are notes for integrating ki and its use with every class in the game, including vows of discipline and their impact on ki, with special attention paid to expanded options for the the monk, ninja, and samurai.<br><br>Under Frozen Stars. On an epic journey across the far frozen wastes, your characters seek their destiny and that of the future empress. Yet at the top of the world, having overcome the ravening storms and dark forces arrayed against them, you discover a marvel of legend, a ruined city both ancient and alien. Surely you cannot simply pass it by without exploring it and seeing what mysteries have lain untouched for time out of mind. Then again, if the rumors told in the caravan are true, perhaps others have come not so long ago, leaving behind a mysterious treasure that may be of great aid in claiming your imperial destiny in the eastern realms.<br><br>This adventure for characters of 7th to 9th level supplements (with scaling notes to use the adventure with higher or lower-level adventurers) the epic journey at the midpoint of the Far East Adventure Path campaign. It allows PCs a chance to stop and explore one of the notable locations they discover along the way, helping balance out what can become an arduous grind of seemingly disconnected events on their polar crossing.
