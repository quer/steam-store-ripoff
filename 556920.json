Decide at the beginning of each turn, what everybody is going to do. Envisoning possible issues during the progression of the turn is the key to victory. <br></li><li>Character progression: There are no class restrictions. Plan the development of each party member from the beginning. Do you want specialists or generalists? The choice is yours. <br></li><li>Crafting system: Do you want to rely on random gear dropping or would you rather create specific gear, that will help you in your quest? Choose wisely. <br></li><li>Manage resources: Your party will eventually become hungry and thirsty.
