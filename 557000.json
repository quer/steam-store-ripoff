The man was well-known for his stature, his ability to carry around a full-sized cannon by himself, and his skill in actually firing the thing. He boarded many shipping vessels, claimed some booty, and distributed it fairly amongst his crew. He was as much a gentlemen as he was a fearsome rogue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut disaster struck when one day he boarded a vessel operated by the Order of Popae Monks. When one of the monks was accidentally sucked out of the airlock, The Grand Space Butterfly took offense and cursed the pirate and his crew. On that day, Captain McPain became a ghost that would forever haunt the shipping lanes throughout the Galaxy. A haunting visage that strikes fear into those that travel the void!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis DLC contains a custom skin for Ted McPain in Awesomenauts. You need to have Ted McPain available as a playable character in order to access the skin in-game. Owning this skin will also unlock the special portrait for use in-game. The Scourge Captain McPain skin comes with a unique character theme, killing spree theme, a unique voiceover, and special in-game audio effects for his abilities.",
