Not only was this a boon for scientific observation, it ultimately helped us realize that our senses could accept an artificial impression of life as a substitute for the real thing. Perfecting this substitution has been avidly pursued ever since. The rise of film, TV, and video games is a testament to our collective interest in experiencing a simulated presentation of the world. So it seemed fitting to create a space in virtual reality that acknowledges the new medium's lineage by calling back to Muybridge's early experiments.",
