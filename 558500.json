Curved surfaces and stairs allow you to walk from the floor, up the walls and across ceilings, shifting gravity and giving you a whole new perspective!<br />\r\nCollect crystals to power teleports and open up new areas. Some cystals are in easy reach, others require devious puzzles to be solved or challenges completed.<br />\r\nLandscape platforms can be moved and rotated using buttons and wheels to transform the landscape and form bridges. Machines require wiring together correctly to active them. If that isn't challenge enough, the local inhabitants are not entirely friendly. Watch out for dragons, jumping crabs and killer robots as well as laser beams which should be avoided at all costs (or find a laser pistol to dispatch them).<br />\r\nNow features three control styles : teleportation, sliding using the teleport beam or track pad control.",
