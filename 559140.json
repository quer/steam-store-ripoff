And its legal!  You can throw bowling balls at these pinheads all day long.  Some of them will even like it.  Not only the pinheads at the end of the lane, but also the rest of the pinheads taking up space.  As long as you are playing this game, you’ll never have to be polite to any pinhead you see.  That is our promise to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPinheads Bowling VR is a fun fun fun new way to play the classic game of bowling with animated pins that react as you bowl.  The game is built on a hyper-realistic physics simulation, so whether you like to put spin on the ball and curve it in for a strike or throw straight down the lane, you will feel like you are bowling at a real bowling alley.  That is…if real bowling alleys were filled with living bowling pins.
