As the sole ex-Consortium crewmember, you were not injected with the test of loyalty serum. Your friends were not so lucky. The active virus in the serum mutated and transformed them into abhorrent monsters. The ship has turned against you. Your mission? Travel to the event horizon and leverage the crystal power source to go back in time to before the tragic events that killed your family. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile you were asleep, monsters consumed your ship's energy source, a crystal of legendary origin. As you wake up from cryogenic sleep, you find yourself in a ship where nothing is as you remember. Monsters will spawn in the darkness and attempt to attack you and your defenses until you manage to restore power to the entire ship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you navigate through the many rooms in your ship, you will unlock new weapons and defensive structures. You will be able to build &amp; upgrade towers to help defend rooms that you have already reclaimed. As you amass more crystals, you have to continually choose between stronger weapons or building defenses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour decisions matter: turning the lights on too quickly, and you will get overrun, but without power, you will be left in the darkness. Your defensive structures won't work and are left to your flashlight and your keen sense of hearing when monsters creep up on you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStarship Survivor is not a wave shooter. Each game features unique procedurally generated levels which are yours to explore. Starship Survivor is equal parts shooter and strategy. Rooms are dark, and it's up to you to restore power to the ship, build defensive structures and upgrade your weapons. The closer you are to your goal, the fiercer your opponents become. They will steal your crystals and weaken you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuilt from the ground up for virtual reality, Starship Survivor is a suspenseful shooter which will immerse you in an action-packed experience you will not forget quickly. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCool Features:<br />\r\n- Big levels with free movement - NOT a wave shooter<br />\r\n- Gather crystals and spend them!<br />\r\n- Unlock various weapons and upgrade them with crystals<br />\r\n- Suspenseful monsters.
