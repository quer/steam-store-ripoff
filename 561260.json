The titular characters are confined to the realms of light and dark and are only able to progress through constant cooperation. Each puzzle requires you to explore and understand how you can best manipulate the environment and utilize the characters' special abilities to reach their respective goals. <br><br>The game is set in the ancient world of Yril, a once vibrant land now a faded shell of its former self. At an uncertain point in time, two kindred spirits have manifested themselves as the Rabbit and the Owl. You will guide them through tranquil forests, harsh deserts, crumbling cities, and more while seeing echoes of the past toward a fateful encounter in the depths of Mount Rulnar.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rich puzzles:<br>The game naturally introduces and teaches puzzle-solving concepts as you progress. Each puzzle may draw on concepts learned before but always has a specific light bulb moment that is unique only to that level. Variety is the spice of life!<br></li><li>Low mechanical skill ceiling:<br>Mechanical execution of moving the characters, activating switches, using special abilities, etc. is designed to be less demanding for players who may not be the best at platformers or games in general. The puzzles are mostly solved through careful analysis of <i>what</i> to do -- the difficulty of actually completing them is kept to a minimum.<br></li><li>Atmospheric, cohesive aesthetics:<br>Unique, painterly artwork for every level and a soothing, original soundtrack to complement the game and the story.<br></li><li>Co-op:<br>Play solo by swapping between control of the Rabbit and the Owl, or play with a friend by plugging in a controller or two (currently only shared screen and officially tested for Xbox 360/One controllers). There is an unofficial workaround for playing online co-op, but your mileage may vary. <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/games/561260/announcements/detail/1693803421734426665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Read more about it here.</a><br></li><li>Interpretive story:<br>Piece together the mythology of the world and Yril's past to discover why the Rabbit and the Owl are here now.</li></ul>",
