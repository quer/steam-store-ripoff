The plane started its military service as a bomber in Spanish civil war. It played a tremendous role in many operations including dropping paratroopers over Crete, delivering supplies to the Afrika Corps, evacuating wounded from the Kuban front and rescuing German forces trapped in Demyansk and Stalingrad pockets. Despite being considered obsolete during most of the war, the Ju-52 proved itself as very dependable and sturdy aircraft. Many countries continued to use these planes for a long time even after the war.<br> <br>The aircraft in the game is capable of carrying cargo, drop cargo containers and Fallschirmjager troops.
