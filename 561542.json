The character can also be purchased with Awesomepoints in-game.<br><br>Penny Fox is a complex assassin that gains charges that empower her abilities with her melee attack.

She comes equipped with the following abilities:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Consume charges to pounce forward, knocking back enemies you come in contact with.<br></li><li>Consume charges to shoot a piercing energy pulse that amplifies damage.<br></li><li>Strike enemies with your claw, and receive a charge when hitting an enemy.</li></ul><br><i>As an honorary Star Scout, Penny's lifestyle was one of exploration and adventure. During her years out scout-badge-hunting among the stars on her trusty space-scooter, she saw many wonderous places and lifeforms.<br><br>One of the many hobbies that developed during these years, is the collecting and stuffing in jars of those same wonderous lifeforms and various other doodads. Cataloguing and archiving everything in neatly labeled containers for her own private collection is something Penny takes great pride in.<br><br>While adding the latest uncooperative alien lifeform to her jar collection, she contemplated the meaning of life, the universe and everything. Looking back on all those innocently staring eyes from the rows upon rows of jars, Penny realised that there was so much more a sole Star Scout could do with a butterfly net! She swore a vow on scout's honor to stuff the galaxy's evil doers into her jars, making the universe a better place for the cute and the cuddly!<br><br>Without a second thought she jumped on her scooter and set off toward the stars. It was well beyond the point of no return when she realised that her trusty yet rather dated mode of transportation might not be up to the task of traversing the universe without the not-so-annual tune-up she forgot for the fifth year in a row.<br><br>As the scooter shuddered to an embarrassing stop somewhere in the Raki system, she kept her calm and assessed the situation. A brief scan for spare parts showed a strange uncharted derelict station in the vicinity which seemed to have everything she needed to fix her broken mode of transport. Awkwardly making her way toward it using the Star Scout approved Deep-Space Breast Stroke, she found the name &quot;Starstorm&quot; emblazoned on the hull of this grimy time-worn, and seemingly abandoned space station.<br><br>During her searches inside the bowels of the station, she found a mysterious robotic claw artifact. Curiosity being known to killing the inferior feline species, this confident canine locked it immediately to her wrist and was suddenly awash with power.<br><br>Unbeknownst to Penny, she had just taken the first step toward the biggest adventure of her life!</i>",
