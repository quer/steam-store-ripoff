Using her cute puppy-dog eye routine she managed to hitchhike her way across the galaxy and ended up with the Awesomenauts who, after her tantrums left half the ship in ruins, couldn't wait to get her in a droppod and away from their precious belongings. Still, she's a cherished member of the group, requiring only a gold-star sticker for her efforts on the field of battle!</i>",
