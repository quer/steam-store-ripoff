Can step off, leaving his bike as a static turret. Can throw bombs that stick to enemies and deal area damage after a delay. He comes equipped with the following abilities:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Step on your bike to drive into combat with increased speed and a directional shot. When you dismount you'll deploy your bike as a rapid shooting turret.<br></li><li>Throw a sticky bomb to stick onto anything. Explodes in an area after being stuck for some time. This skill changes into a Nitro Boost when on your bike.<br></li><li>Shoot two successive shots each time. Changes into a forward rapid shot when on your bike.</li></ul><br><i>Chucho comes from a rich, if slightly shady family called the Krokk. Let’s face facts here: they may have achieved fame and fortune on Calias by hunting down the biggest criminals in the galaxy, but they’re just as bad themselves. But hey, it takes a crook to catch a crook, so Chucho has taken up the family mantle of being a BAD-ASS BOUNTY HUNTER.<br><br>Which wouldn’t be so awkward if he didn’t have the world’s largest lisp. Oh well. No time for that, because the self-styled “Time Krokk” is on the hunt for a time traveling criminal (a practice strictly forbidden under the intergalactic portal law, ever since someone went back in time to steal cocoa beans for a fondue, and accidentally ended up wiping out chocolate from history).<br><br>Since the Krokks and Zorks have been vicious rivals for centuries he raised quite some eyebrows when out of nowhere he signed up for the Awesomenauts. In his inventory rests a suspicious, smelly time traveling slipper that might lead him to an altogether deadly confrontation with his unsuspecting bounty...<br><br>The Krokk have been suspected of working together with many criminal organizations such as Shisu, the underwater maffia, the religious clown killers known as the Grint and some even suspect links with the lizard Sisterhood of Coba. None of these have ever been confirmed, however. Chucho's homeplanet is Calias which is a rich and tech-heavy planet. A lot of rich industrial corporations are based here mainly due to the mining of power crystals on Luxor, Calias' last moon.</i>",
