Shrouded in mystery, no one actually knows why she would ever be part of the royal court of the Scargi, considering the insectoid Chilasi and snail-like Scargi have been in a long dispute over the giant splumb gardens scattered across the planet. These two realms came to a head when the Chilasi vehemently maintained that the Splumb potatoes are a form of fruit yet the Scargi are extremely sure that it's, in fact, a vegetable. This could, naturally, only be settled with war.

Don't be fooled by her captivating looks because this deadly warrior has the best k/d in Scargi space.<br><br>She does have one guilty pleasure: every spare moment not seducing her enemies she can be found behind a frying pan, nibbling on some fried splumb taters. Her perfect curves stay in shape because of her hightened metabolism, but rumor has it that she is so obsessed with her looks that she even rubs her carapace with the yellow fruit to give it a golden shine. Never tell her that she has a problem, though, because she will cut you into tiny tiny pieces with her venom bladed chakrams.<br><br>Being from a different kingdom she has always been a bit of an outsider, but the renegades took her in as if she was family, After the incident at the palace she hid in the hot wastelands where the Scargi wouldn't be able to track her.
