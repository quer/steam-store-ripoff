This approach would mean a variety of different locomotives, for various duties, could share a common range of parts and operate in a similar manner, keeping overall costs down.<br><br>Many of the standard locomotive features were based on LMS designs, however, the 2-6-0 variant of the BR Standard Class 4 would be designed at Doncaster, an ex-LNER Works. 25 were built in Doncaster, and in fact the final one was the last steam locomotive to ever be built there; an additional 90 locomotives were built between Horwich and Derby Works, bringing the total up to 115.<br><br>The BR Standard Class 4 2-6-0 “Mogul” was built for freight duties first and foremost, however their mixed-traffic capabilities would eventually see them on passenger trains as well. They would be spread out across the country, allocated to depots in the Eastern, London Midland, North Eastern, Scottish and Southern regions, making them a regular sight for all workers, commuters and enthusiasts of the era.<br><br>Due to their introduction in the sunset years of steam, the class never really got a chance to prove itself; modernisation would run rampant in the 1960s and many examples wouldn’t even see a decade of service in before being withdrawn in favour of diesels.
