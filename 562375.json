In particular, the Metro-Cammell-built 1938 Stock spent their first 50 years on the Bakerloo, Northern, Piccadilly, Central Lines and even the sub-surface East London Line.

While a couple of the engines await restoration in real life, London Transport’s Panniers will be raring to steam in Train Simulator, with lucky passengers in-tow as you manage the pressure on the historical run.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BR Class 20</h2>As the era of steam ended, the British railway network was in need on an entirely new generation of motive power. English Electric would be the starting gun for the country’s early diesels, and one of their pioneering designs, the Type 1, was built as a mixed-goods locomotive that could replace a large sum of not only steam traction, but also other early diesels which were proven unreliable. In recent years, the remaining Type 1 fleet, or as it was re-classified, the Class 20, is usually found on engineering trains, or of course passenger excursions.<br><br><br>For the London Transport Heritage Collection, BR Class 20 No. 20142 is featured in her newly applied maroon and gold livery, as the 20s are well known for engineering operations across London Underground lines and taking part in special celebrations.
