Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation. <br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://train-simulator.com/the-ts-pro-range-roster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >See the entire Pro Range</a></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>It was on May 10, 1869 at Promontory, Utah that the “Golden Spike” ceremony made America one land, linked by rail from ocean to ocean. Facing each other on that historic day were two locomotives, Union Pacific 4-4-0 No. 119 and Central Pacific No. 60, the “Jupiter.” <br><br>Now, through the extraordinary craftsmanship of Smokebox, Central Pacific’s 4-4-0 Jupiter comes to life in Train Simulator! <br><br>Central Pacific No. 60, along with three sisters (“Storm,” “Whirlwind,” and “Leviathan”) were built by the Schenectady Locomotive Works in the summer of 1868. The wood-burning locomotives were designed for dual service, with 60-inch-diameter drivers and 16 x 24-inch cylinders and a total engine weight of 65,400 pounds. Following the historic events of May 1869, the Jupiter went on to a long career working for the Central Pacific and its successor, the Southern Pacific.<br><br> In the mid-1970s, the U. S. National Park Service had full-sized, operating replicas of UP No. 119 and the Jupiter constructed, a process that included the creation of engineering drawings of the locomotives. It is from those plans that Smokebox has created the Train Simulator version of the famed Jupiter. And as can be expected from the creator of the Union Pacific FEF-3 4-8-4 and AT&amp;N 2-8-0, the Jupiter features extraordinary operating realism and exacting detail authenticity true to the wood-burning locomotives as built in 1868. <br><br>The Central Pacific Jupiter pack includes the historic Jupiter as well as sister locomotives Storm, Whirlwind, and Leviathan; authentic flat cars, baggage car, various styles of Emigrant coaches, and a coach-caboose with detailed passenger views; and a variety of new track and scenery assets designed to allow route builders to create their own 19th century railroad routes!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2>Fittingly, given that Central Pacific’s crown-jewel accomplishment was its crossing of California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains, the pack includes three captivating and challenging career scenarios on the Train Simulator Donner Pass route (available as a separate purchase).<br> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Storm's on its Way  <br></li><li> Storming the Hill<br></li><li> Storm's Passing</li></ul><br><strong>Please Note: The <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/65239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Donner Pass: Southern Pacific Route Add-On</a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.</strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
