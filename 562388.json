This flagship of the ÖBB promises authenticity abounds as it arrives for Train Simulator service!<br><br>The ÖBB 4010 provided a long-distance express service between Vienna and Zurich in the form of the “Transalpin”. Simmering-Graz-Pauker rolled three of the new train sets, classified as the ÖBB 4010, off the production line in 1965. Formed of a power car, cab car and four intermediate coaches fitted with first and second class throughout, the new fleet would quickly revolutionise luxury rail travel and would serve the route all the way into the mid-2000s.<br><br>Getting familiar with the cab of the ÖBB 4010 is key to success. Being a design from the 1960s, it features many classic dials, switches and controls which, while modern for the time, contrast quite considerably with the multiple units of today. With of-the-era rudimentary systems on-board, starting up the ÖBB 4010 is a fairly easy procedure once you know where the relevant controls are; simply raise the pantograph, turn on the main switch, select your intended direction of travel, set the lights up appropriately and you’re good to go.<br><br>Where the level of complexity increases aboard the ÖBB 4010 is in its driving wheel. When mastered, getting just the right amount of power out of the multiple unit, and knowing how to change it, means a hassle-free journey and a smooth ride for the passengers.<br><br>Despite being retired just over 9 years ago, the ÖBB 4010s history culminated in a 3-decade express service history, and time as famed traction throughout the Alpine region.
