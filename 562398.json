Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The distinctive and incredible GWR Large Prairies comes to Train Simulator to fulfil a multitude of steam-era roles, courtesy of Partner Programme developer Victory Works.<br><br>In general, a “Prairie” steam locomotive is any that sits upon a 2-6-2 wheel arrangement, and particularly in tank locomotive form proved a very popular design worldwide. On British soil, the Southern Railway would be the only example of the “Big Four” to not produce Prairie locomotives in its lifetime.<br><br>The Great Western Railway however would dote on their 2-6-2T ‘tank’ locomotives for secondary and more rural duties. Some of the earliest examples were rather light, and were suitably called the ‘Small Prairies’; however, larger variants would also be produced, primarily for suburban commuter operations but initially for general use too. First appearing in 1903, these are the ‘Large Prairies’.<br><br>The first of many Large Prairies appeared in 1903 as GWR No. 99, a prototype design from Churchward that would become the basis for a production fleet of 39 ‘3100 Class’ tank locomotives. At heart, the 3100 Class was a mixed-traffic locomotive, and would be the start of a “workhorse” fleet for GWR and be found across the network throughout their lifetimes.<br><br>Differences between the prototype and production 3100s were next to none, only the tank shape was altered to improve visibility. Naturally, changes were implemented over time to improve the class, including altered weight distribution and a larger coal bunker; these changes warranted a fleet-wide reclassification, and so was introduced the 5100 Class, as most would now stay until withdrawal.<br><br>A handful of 5100 Class locomotives received further modifications in the late 1930s and were once again given new numbers. This move took place to bolster another fleet of Large Prairies, a fleet which was introduced earlier in the decade and itself derived from yet another production batch.<br><br>In the late 1920s, Churchward’s successor, Collett, sought to update the original 3100 Class design and have a large fleet built to fulfil local, suburban passenger roles. In fact, it was Collett’s development that resulted in the 3100 Class becoming the 5100 Class, all while a new batch of 5101 Class locomotives were produced to the same standard. Whereas only 40 of the original were built, Swindon Works would deliver 140 members of 5101 Class between 1929 and 1949.<br><br>Together, the 5100s and 5101s dominated traffic in all corners of the Great Western network, quickly growing and becoming a regular sight on all kinds of trains right up the end of the Second World War. Post-conflict, a rise in road usage and the introduction of diesel traction took its toll on the Large Prairies’ duties, seeing them take on new life as mainline support engines; providing backup as pilots and bankers on the more troublesome sections of the GWR such as the South Devon Banks, or the Severn Tunnel.<br><br>While prolific, the Large Prairies still only represent a portion of the entire fleet. A further 70 locomotives are still to be accounted for. These come in the form of the 6100 Class, another of Collett’s finest and built specifically for commuter services out of London Paddington.<br><br>The “Networkers” of their day, the 6100 Class was introduced in 1931 as a development of the 5101, and was based at Old Oak Common, Slough, Reading, and elsewhere. Being prominent in the passenger scene, enthusiasts quickly took to the class and nicknamed them ‘Tanner One-ers’, a call to their 61xx numbering and some currency of the day, a sixpence and a penny.<br><br>Much like the other Large Prairies’ story, a future of diesel forced the 6100s into other positions, but not before the fleet was joined by a previously mentioned extra batch of locomotives; may the 5100 Class re-enter centre stage.<br><br>It was the 6100 fleet that was reinforced by a modified micro fleet of 5100s; the latter was rebuilt with smaller driving and pony truck wheels, and received a boiler pressure increase (a common Large Prairie modification). 10 rebuilt 5100 Class locomotives were renumbered into the 8100 Class, and were destined to work alongside the 6100s, supposedly providing extra acceleration characteristics owing to their smaller wheels.<br><br>All GWR Large Prairie locomotives survived until the end of steam, by which point many of them were still in good shape, despite the oldest examples working beyond their 6th decade. Unfortunately, very few avoided the cutters’ torch after the steam-era’s final chapter. None of the 5100 or 8100 made it into the epilogue, it was a spot only reserved for 10 5101s and a lone 6100. Even then, only 4 out of the 11 are operational. Well, technically 5 see heritage service, but one was rebuilt into a 4300 Class tender locomotive. The rest are awaiting overhaul, apart from 6106 which is on static display at Didcot.<br><br>Fantastically, Victory Works has translated the GWR Large Prairies into Train Simulator, and the pack contains a bumper collection which Includes the 5100, 5101, 6100 and 8100 classes in GWR Green and British Railways Black liveries, complete with selectable era-appropriate logos, optional parts and fittings and a large variety of detail throughout!<br><br>The Tanner One-ers, the Large Prairies, a Great Western classic is yours to master in Train Simulator!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>The GWR Large Prairies Steam Loco Add-on includes four challenging career scenarios for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/325960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Riviera Line in the Fifties: Exeter - Kingswear Route Add-On</a>:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Friday Commute<br></li><li>Winter Mix<br></li><li>Tunnel Inspection<br></li><li>Fast Fitted Freight </li></ul><br><strong>Please Note: The <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/325960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Riviera Line in the Fifties: Exeter - Kingswear Route Add-On</a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.</strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
