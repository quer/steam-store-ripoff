Powerful Warstones also appear occasionally which give significant bonuses to defenders standing on them.

Each mode has a unique achievement which gives a star when completed, the color of the star corresponds to the difficulty of the mission: gold for Nightmare, silver for Hard, and bronze for Normal. Levels have a lot of possible solutions but, with so many combinations, you're going to need to perfect your strategy to master them.
