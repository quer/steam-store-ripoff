It's special in an industry striving for photo-realism. Throw all of this in with an ass-kicking midi soundtrack and Ion Maiden has the potential of becoming another instant classic and a fine addition to the Build Engine library of games”<br />\r\n-Destructoid<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I can't wait to play ION MAIDEN - what a great idea. Make a Duke Nukem 3D-like 90's build-engine shooter that looks pixel-perfect.”<br />\r\n-John Romero<br />\r\n",
