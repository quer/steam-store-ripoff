Your goal is to construct a beacon of light to call for help and find your way home. Along the way, you will be able to discover pieces of your past, memories lost after your arrival in the caves.

Yet, the decision to actually make this beacon or even seek out your past is your own; you can choose to find your way out of the caverns or to start a new life underground by following either of the two paths to the end of your journey.
