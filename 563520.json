When Our Journey Ends felt different than any of the visual novels I’ve played before, yet familiar as if it were an old fairy tale. The story as a whole, including the extra chapters, is something I am very glad I got to experience. I found myself more and more attached to the characters, wanting to know more. Wanting more stories. I felt happy when I finished this visual novel.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://nardio.net/2017/02/24/when-our-journey-ends-a-visual-novel-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Nardio</a><br>",
