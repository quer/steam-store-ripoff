Each of the game's seventeen stages is filled with treacherous terrain and swarms of enemies ready to make quick work of our plucky young heroine. Guide Spiritia safely to the boss at the end of each stage and use all of the abilities at your disposal to knock some sense into them.<br><br><br>Upon defeating a boss for the first time, Spiritia may acquire a new magical ability or two. There are plenty of unique abilities scattered throughout the game, and some of them can make particularly troublesome areas much easier to navigate. Each boss is especially vulnerable to certain abilities, so learning to pinpoint and exploit these weaknesses is bound to make defeating them a lot less painful (for you, not them).<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/564150/extras/story.jpg?t=1549368123\" ><br>Having recently completed a six-month-long teaching assignment for the Holy Empire, Spiritia Rosenberg was anxious to return home to her friends and get some well-deserved rest.<br><br><br>Unfortunately, her homecoming would not be the warm welcome she had expected.

Moments later, flames engulfed the training grounds and its surroundings, ruthlessly consuming everything in their wake. With no time to lose, Spiritia and her fairy companion Lilli rushed into the burning forest in pursuit.<br><br>Making her way through the roaring flames, Spiritia was overjoyed to find her best friend, the cool and collected Freudia Neuwahl, already on the scene. However, her joy quickly turned to horror as she learned the identity of the arsonists; her own organization of magicians, Rosenkreuzstilette, with Freudia herself leading the assault.<br><br>Freudia informed Spiritia of the unit's decision to rise against the injustices fostered by the Empire, inviting her to rejoin their comrades as they declared war on mankind.
