This is a story about a boy who wakes into a world of darkness. He ventures deep into the world ever changing. He finds beauty and mystery in the dark and strange world as well as a girl who seems to be as unique as him. Together they venture forth to rid of the world they are in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game follows the story of the Major Arcana of a Tarot deck. The game has numerous features such as a variety of puzzles some unique to the game with combinations of it; Semi rogue-like levels that give each computer a set of levels that is unique for each one; A smart AI that you can avoid danger but may still be lead to its death; Challenge modes and YOLO mode that can give a more rogue-like experience with a cost of a life; and more to follow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is more to the game, as an early access it is still under construction. So please, bare with me as I make more levels and features. Only one person is working on the game with only his free time to work with. Which I am hoping to change.",
