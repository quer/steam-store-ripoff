You've read this text, you've looked at these screenshots, and you've watched this trailer. Not once, but a hundred times. Maybe even more. And in five minutes, you won't remember any of it – and do it all over again.<br><br>Escape the Loop is an episodic open-world adventure game about time and recollection. You're stuck in a time loop – after five minutes, the world goes back to its initial state. Everything resets. You keep nothing. Except your memory of past loops. Every loop will be exactly the same, unless you change it through your actions. Use your knowledge of previous loops to find out what causes the time disruptions and break free once and for all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Open-world Episodic Game</h2>You don't really hear the terms <i>open-world</i> and <i>episodic</i> together that often. It may seem somewhat counter intuitive to combine both in a single game, but Escape the Loop does just that. This unique approach will allow you to spend as much time with one episode, as you want. Try figuring out how to beat it, or waste your days exploring town, annoying neighbors, learning to play an instrument, or do whatever else you can think of doing in a time loop.<br>Each episode will not only be another chapter in Amelia's story, but also add a unique twist to the time loop mechanic, changing the town and its residents in new ways. This will make every episode as explorable as the previous one, with new things to do and more time to spend.",
