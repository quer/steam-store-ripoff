Gameplay Notes:\r\nThe game is open ended, and it's a roguelike so if your character dies, they get deleted. \r\nBe careful when starting a new character and you can also use your partner Bill to help with beginning enemies. \r\nEven a powerful combination of powers still leaves your young character vulnerable to most enemies. \r\nThe controls are mouse all three buttons and Keyboard W,A,S,D there are also lots of little secrets.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Project Almighty\r\n\r\nThe code name for the Super Agent project, you've been unleashed on a corrupted town taken over by mobs of crazy criminals bent on ravaging, raiding and causing mayhem. Can you answer the call for a hero? Take back the streets and homes of the terrified population frozen in fear. \r\n\r\nYou start by creating any character you can think up, experiment with different powers and abilities, punch, blast and blow up tons of bad guys. Design the look of your avenger of the weak.\r\n\r\nRandom Encounters!\r\n\r\nArcade combat with your custom Superhero! Find out the strengths and weaknesses of every type of hero!\r\n\r\nBe careful because even a seemingly powerful Super can be defeated and overwhelmed! \r\n\r\nRogue like game play means if your Hero is defeated they are erased from history, but you can just make another to try again to protect the town!\r\n\r\nSave Citizens!\r\n\r\nMake 100's of different Superheroes!\r\n\r\nUse your power patrol the streets and to stop crime, beat down violent criminals in this sandbox town.\r\n\r\nThe town needs your hero to fight off endless gangs and monsters! \r\n\r\nProtect the citizens!",
