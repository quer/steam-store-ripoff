            "detailed_description": "Originally premiering on October 26th, 2017 at Chapman University as a Virtual Reality Experience, The Harvest VR is a short, live-action VR experience created by Chapman University and AMD. The film takes place in a dilapidated barn and features three distinct characters: a deranged farmer/murder, his last victim (who he has mummified in burlap and is getting ready to string up on his farm as a scarecrow), and his next victim - you!! This first person experience has plenty of action and thrills, but is just tame enough for non-horror fans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe premiere of The Harvest VR took place in Chapman University's Digital Media Arts Center. The building was taken over for the night and decorated to fit the atmosphere of the film. Participants sat in groups to view the experience and had the option of having their arms tied (safely) to their chair to mirror the situation of their character in the film.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter viewing the film, participants made their way deeper into the haunted house-esque Digital Media Arts Center and experienced the The Harvest VR game in pods. Participants waiting in line had the added enjoyment of watching their friends get spooked.",
