Super smooth free flying, karma and resource management and an starports with game statistics. Different types of mining from fast paced asteroid splitting to planet scale thermonuclear detonations which literally vaporize a complete planetary crust into oblivion, for your convenience. Everything wrapped inside clear and modern game visualization and focused usability.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">For PC and VR</h2>The game in its entirety is designed for traditional PC playing in mind from the very beginning. In addition we have made it fully VR compatible for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The thing is, lightning fast free glide right next to a massive planet in VR feels absolutely amazing!",
