Then Psyche Soldier VR is for you... and will take you to battles inside the psychedelic realm of your subconscious, tackling shadow creatures using five different Caster light-energy attacks, a channel ability, a spotlight, and an active Power Up. Challenge yourself!<br><br><strong>Description</strong><br>What if renowned Psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, were to have made a Virtual Reality game? It would have been something like Psyche Soldier VR.<br><br>Psyche Soldier VR is a challenging, truly dynamic, duck-and-dodge shooting gallery game that takes place in the player's subconscious. Players cast light energy to battle against the shadow aspects of their psyche in seven different themed missions: Agency, Attachment, Fear, Procrastination, Shame, Stress, and Perfection. Each mission features unique enemies related to the theme along with a challenging Boss Fight! In addition, there is a Secret Boss Fight! There's even a dog you can play fetch with in the menu area, who can also appear as an energy form in the subconscious to save the player from failure.<br><br>Unlike games with a passive shield, the action-based Power Up ability is both defensive and offensive -- surrounding, protecting, increasing damage, and strengthening slowing power with the press of a button. Add that to the five Caster abilities, the Spotlight slow, the Energy Collect channel ability, the fluid energy system, and the 18 different enemy types, and what you get is an on-the-fly strategic and athletic game that truly uses the dual controller and room scale aspects of VR, making it unlike any other!<br><br>There is an experience-based upgrade system to empower your abilities and chances, and four difficulties to test your skill: Easy, Normal, Mentalist, and Psychonaut.
