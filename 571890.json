We are working on offering the most powerful and easiest VR design and presentation software solutions for professional and newcomer creators and designers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Early Access release empowers non-professional VR device owners to release their creativity and make their very own, colorful virtual 3D models and assets. The joint forces of Leopoly engine and VR devices simplifies the modeling process by enabling users to create in a fun and intuitive way. Users can sculpt, paint and play effortlessly while turning their imagination into reality. All designs can be saved in STL or OBJ file format for easy 3D printing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Import your own objects, view them in a chosen VR context, modify, save, 3D print<br />\r\n- Use predesigned 3D model templates or start creating from scratch<br />\r\n- Present your creations in the most fitting VR environment<br />\r\n- 10 sculpting tools and growing<br />\r\n- Limitless painting, various colors<br />\r\n- 6 different sculpting materials<br />\r\n- Numerous design environments<br />\r\n- Mesh-based sculpting<br />\r\n- Vertex painting<br />\r\n- Real-time polygon generation and optimization<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game changing virtual experience provides a natural environment for creation in the real world just as traditional sculpting and object formation is done. We believe that with our solution, creation is more intuitive, a lot more engaging and allow people to tap into creativity they’ve never used.<br />\r\nOne key differentiator between Shapelab and the other solutions, is its usage of mesh-based modeling rather than voxel-based modeling. For most of the 3D assets, mesh-based modeling is more optimal than voxel if you would like to avoid blocky, rasterized designs. Realistic, detailed voxel models require significantly more memory than realistic polygonal models. Using voxel technology also means that you are dealing with not only the surface, but every internal “3D pixels / blocks” as well. On the top of all these, mesh based technology also makes it possible to vary the resolution in the same mesh. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat’s next?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe will add more powerful design tools, support more platforms, and turn the entire application into a social, shared virtual reality experience. Imagine when you meet your buddies - living in another city or country - for a co-creation party in VR. Leopoly will let you collaborate with others, combine your imaginations, share your designs and get inspired by each-others works.<br />\r\nPlanned features and tools:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- VR Presentation mode: Real-time streaming, and 3D/VR viewing to let multiple users and decision makers to see, examine and observe creation processes, 3D models, assets, virtual environments and digital prototypes <br />\r\n- Co-creation mode – modelling with others at the same time, even the same mesh<br />\r\n- Scene/Environment building and editing<br />\r\n- Multi object handling and new design tools<br />\r\n- Object mixing<br />\r\n- Open desktop in VR<br />\r\n- Full control over polygon numbers<br />\r\n- Taking screenshots, record videos<br />\r\n- Online, browser based model sharing<br />\r\n- Import models from Leopoly Cloud<br />\r\n- Voice control",
