            "reviews": "“Nancy Drew: Sea of Darkness presented a well-woven plot to uncover, an interesting back-story of both the characters and the town, and a set of puzzles and circumstances that were challenging, but not frustratingly difficult. If you’re a seasoned player of the Nancy Drew mysteries, I think you’ll be pleased with this entertaining title. If you’re a new player, looking for the perfect game out of the 32 to get started with, I’d highly recommend this one as a prime example of the quality of the series. The price point is well worth the hours of enjoyment you’ll receive from solving a mystery alongside the most famous young female detective of all time. So grab a copy and, as Her Interactive challenges you to do in the opening titles, “Dare to Play.””<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://computertimes.com/NancyDrewSeaOfDarkness.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Computer Times</a><br><br>“Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this game. The game looks better than I expected, had an interesting story, and difficult puzzles that kept me in to the game. While this style of game may not be everyone’s favorite, for those who do enjoy it this game comes highly recommended. Even those who are not as interested in the genre should check this game out, and will probably enjoy it like I did.”<br>PoisonKiwi<br><br>“Overall Sea of Darkness was an enjoyable game, especially if you enjoy “brain teaser” puzzles that are more challenging than what’s found in today’s casual games.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gameboomers.com/reviews/Nn/ND32/ND32.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameBoomers</a><br>",
