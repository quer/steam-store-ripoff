Nancy Drew: Labyrinth of Lies is a game that cannot be missed by any fan of either the franchise, adventure games, or simply of a good mystery.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://computertimes.com/LabyrinthofLies.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Computer Times</a><br><br>“Overall, this was a solid addition to the Nancy Drew series. Diehard fans will be relieved to see some recurring problems get addressed, and casual players will enjoy the variety of puzzles and the characters that make this engine churn. If you’re a Greek history nut looking for an authentic experience of the country, Labyrinth of Lies probably isn’t for you, but it’s a good way to dip your toe in the water. This game won’t become the stuff of myths, but it’s a worthy diversion.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://justadventure.com/index.php/2013-05-20-21-09-14/2379-nancy-drew-labyrinth-of-lies-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Just Adventure</a><br>",
