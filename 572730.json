If you’re a fan of the series, or of adventure games in general, this is a title you should get.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://truepcgaming.com/2013/10/28/nancy-drew-the-silent-spy-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >True PC Gaming</a><br><br>““All in all, Nancy Drew: The Silent Spy is another great addition to the franchise. With this game, I applaud Her Interactive for taking the series into a more serious and mature direction. At a minimum, the game helps to develop Nancy as a deep and compelling character. The fun puzzles add to the enjoyment of the game – they are just difficult enough to be challenging without crossing over into frustration. I highly recommend this game to all fans of the series. I also recommend this game as an introduction for gamers who have yet to try out the series.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/831/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Adventure Classic Gaming</a><br><br>““If you’ve never gotten into this series of games in the past, this is a great place to jump in. Nancy Drew: The Silent Spy is a super fun, challenging, and attention grabbing title that will keep you attached to your screen for hours. I have enjoyed each and every title previously published, but I was extra pleased with this newest addition, due in large part to the intriguing plot, as well as the variety of puzzles and locations to explore. I’ve always been a Nancy Drew fan, now it’s time for you to become one too.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://computertimes.com/SilentSpy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Computer Times – Editor’s Choice Winner</a><br>",
