The playing field is a square mouth of one of the sick creatures who have caught a virus, which we’ll strike with a pill. The difficulty of the game is in the controls as controllable objects are moving in pairs in reverse in relation to each other. <br />\r\nThe plot <br />\r\nThe game takes place in a distant galaxy on a square planet. Once a meteorite with some dangerous microbes has fallen on the planet. The microbes have infected the locals with a variety of diseases, so they went to the doctor named Boxhead. In a short time the doctor has created pills which should have helped to cure the diseases. But it turned out that there was one proviso – in order to work out it is strictly forbidden to remove the pill from the mouth, otherwise it will kill you.",
