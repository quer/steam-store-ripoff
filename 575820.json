It's fast-paced, frantic and fun, just how a shooter should be. And it's got the brilliant sense of humour that runs though all Serious Sam games. While it's enjoyable when played alone, it's best enjoyed in co-op. So, grab a friend, get them sat on the couch next to you, and run backwards like a maniac. You'll both have a blast.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamespew.com/2018/05/i-hate-running-backwards-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Spew</a><br>",
