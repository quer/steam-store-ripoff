He also wishes to find and protect his daughter Lucile. You use Purgatory as your base, where you can improve stats, complete challenges and hire new creatures to your cause, ready for the challenge that lies ahead in the land of the living. This takes the form of a map, with each point providing a new journal entry and battle challenge. Many of these battles include hidden surprises such as ambushes and treasure chests, in order to add additional levels of enjoyment to the title.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Reviews of the original Purgatory on Steam:</h2><strong>[NOT]</strong> &quot;Love this game!

I've always been a fan of fantasy strategy games like Age of Wonders and HoMM (and more recently Fire Emblem).
