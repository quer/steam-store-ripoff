            "detailed_description": "<h1>Support the game in Early Access!</h1><p><strong>Gameplay</strong><br><i><strong>The Pit: Infinity</strong></i> is a hybrid of FPS controls, roguelike RPG mechanics and procedurally generated environments, developed with the Unreal engine. Its combination of art, science fiction world-building and gameplay is unique. Nothing quite like it has been done before.<br><br>Most of the available FPS games on the market offer a minimal selection of weapons and opponents, very simple power-ups and little investment in building your character. Most of the available RPG’s on the market are long-term investments in a single story-line, no limited multiplayer options and very little replayability. Other indie teams have attempted to combine procedurally generated levels, FPS controls and roguelike mechanics in the past, but they seldom brought realistic 3D art, science fiction setting and survival horror atmosphere to the table.<br><br><i><strong>The Pit: Infinity</strong></i> is something different from what has come before. And that’s a good thing. We are trying to create a game that will re-invent a genre. <i>The Pit: Infinity</i> now has most of its core features in place. It is stable and playable for the development team, and we are ready for players to put it to the test and help shape its content.<br><br><strong>Controls</strong><br>Currently the game supports keyboard and mouse on a standard PC screen. Use of console controllers is on the developer wish-list for the future. Your camera and inventory controls are a standard first- person shooter model with some additional inventory and feedback.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><i><strong>The Pit: Infinity</strong></i> is a cooperative rpg with first-person-shooter controls and roguelike permadeath. It is meant to be played solo, or cooperatively with up to three friends.<br><br>Players will take on the role of a Marine, Scout or Engineer character and enter the Pit, a high-tech dungeon in which diabolical experiments are performed on life forms gathered from all over the galaxy.<br><br><strong>Game Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Start as one of three unique Characters, each with different Attributes, Skills and Items!<br></li><li>Explore procedurally generated hallways, rooms and biomes!<br></li><li>Battle monsters and robots to gain experience and loot!<br></li><li>Open locked doors and rifle through alien treasure troves, seeking supplies, ammunition and gear!<br></li><li>Gain Levels to improve your Attributes and Skills!<br></li><li>Collect components and craft new items to improve your chances of survival!<br></li><li>Delve as deep into the Pit as you can, before you’re horribly killed! Each new floor becomes more challenging and progressively more difficult to beat.</li></ul><br><strong>HOW LOW CAN YOU GO!?</strong>",
