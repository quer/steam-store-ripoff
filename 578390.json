If you don't like dying or want to run through the game quickly then try out the <i>Tin Can</i> difficulty.

Motion controllers, gamepads and mouse &amp; keyboard setups are all supported. When using motion controllers you have a choice of a few locomotion options such as thumbstick/trackpad movement and teleportation. You can play either sitting or standing, the game isn't room-scaled but you do need a 360 setup if you're going to play standing without thumbstick/trackpad turning. <br><br>If you're used to quick movements in VR then you'll be able dash around your enemies and jump off of ramps. If you prefer an experience that's easier on your stomach then you can use long range teleportation and snipe your enemies across the map. Teleportation works no matter where your destination point is allowing you to focus on your target rather than finding a valid place to teleport. If you need to teleport out of the way quickly just point in the general direction you want to go without looking. If a wall was selected you'll teleport to the nearest point on the floor.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578390/extras/controls5.jpg?t=1531575144\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578390/extras/controls4.jpg?t=1531575144\" ><br><br>Your cannons are controlled based off of where your aiming when using motion controllers.
