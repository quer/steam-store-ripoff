The application will include scans from the brain, abdomen, heart, lungs, spine, and allow users to import their own DICOM files.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsers will be able to directly interact with these models using hand controls, allowing a level of engagement on par with high end virtual reality applications. These controllers will allow the user to scale, rotate, and crop scans freely in 3D space.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUsers can add annotations to specific areas within a scan, to indicate lesions and tumors. The volumes can then be saved and uploaded to be viewed anywhere in the world, all patient health information is removed in the process.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can select between multiple preset color schemes and even create your own. There are multiple environments built in to the Anatomy Viewer to suit your preference.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo apply to the private beta contact us at http://TheBodyVR.com/contact/",
