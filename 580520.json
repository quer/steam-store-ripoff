Your eventual objective: with the help of an AI companion, collect the crystal shards needed to repower your ship, and learn the significance of ocean conservation in preserving our own planet back home.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/alien-water-planet-music-video-game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/alien-water-planet-music-video-game</a><br>",
