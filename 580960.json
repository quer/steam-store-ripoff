Instead of it, in &quot;Little Diggel&quot; you need to think of your actions. All the traps can be passed, overcome or disarmed due to the attentive research of the levels, not the speed of a player's reaction.<br>The game is easy to learn, but it's hard to become a master. Even a successful completion of the level doesn’t guarantee that you have found all the stashes and treasures on the map!",
