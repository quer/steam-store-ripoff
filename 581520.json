In debt and without any other options, he ended up with a low paying cleaning job at a resort with a manager who won’t get off his back. He thought that it would be boring and uneventful… But then, two wand wielding girls appear before him. In the few moments that follow, he learns that evil is a real, tangible force and that magic is also real.<br><br>Although he tries his best to avoid getting involved, the two girls drag him into their battle with the forces of evil. A third girl later appears, tempting him with work that is a bit darker than what he is used to. Will he be able to resist temptation and defeat the evil that is accumulating in the resort?<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/581520/extras/Yuki.png?t=1487874481\" ><br>Yuki is someone who wholeheartedly believes in her mission as a magical girl. She is energetic and performs her job with a passion. There is a slight awkwardness about her when she ends up in an embarrassing situation.

She is kind, and the more level headed girl between her and Yuki. She believes in eradicating evil, and is someone who very much holds love dearly in her heart. She seems to be troubled by something at times, but does her best to make sure that she gets the job done.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/581520/extras/ayame_banner.png?t=1487874481\" ><br>Although she is a magical girl, Ayame is very different from Yuki and Hikari. She does not draw her power from love, but rather through the manipulation of what she calls ‘negative karma’. Through this power, she is able to control evil entities she encounters. She is a domineering personality and seems to relish teasing Taichi, saying whatever she can to get a reaction out of him. However, Taichi suspects that her actions and words do not reflect who she truly is.",
