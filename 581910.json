Harvest resources while defending your team's mothership. Construct frigates, fighters, and stations to fight against hostile forces. Play as a key part of your team, board enemy cruisers, kill their crew, and commandeer enemy craft. Wage all out war until your faction emerges victorious. With multiple ways to play, no two rounds are ever the same.<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mine asteroids</h2></strong><br>Construct new ships using the resources your team mines from asteroids, salvages from wrecks, or captures from planets. Your scrap can be used to construct fighters, frigates, destroyers, or even larger ships for your team.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/581910/extras/ezgif-3-ff7cc0e9f3.png?t=1544396319\" ><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Board enemy ships</h2></strong><br>Hunt down, assault, and board enemy vessels crewed by other players. Capture their ship and refit for your own armada, or salvage their wreckage to augment your own craft. Target ship sub-systems to paralyze critical ship components. Immobilize or cripple enemy cruisers prior to boarding, to maximize potential salvage.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/581910/extras/ezgif-3-2b08d6ffd6.png?t=1544396319\" ><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Construct massive cruisers</h2></strong><br>Build giant vessels, fully crewed by your friends.
