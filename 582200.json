It starts in a real-time automatic training mode that guides you through our visual content. Then, at any time in the application, the user can push the &quot;Mode&quot; button on the VR controller and switch to our interactive training mode. This allows the user to choose which areas they need to focus on and learn at their own pace. This includes a new labeling system which allows you to expand each label to find out more about the exact 3D piece you have selected and to get an in-depth understanding of each structure. <br><br>These new labels also have audio clips attached to them so you can hear exactly how to pronounce the various parts of the model. Even in Chinese. This application also includes an assessment system to judge your learning comprehension with our interactive testing system.
