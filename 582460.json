A unique real-time, cooldown-based combat system challenges players to form combos between their combatants, setting up brutal moves and countering the plans of their opponent. But be careful - every time a Reaper dies, they come back stronger, so moving closer to victory will also make your opposition even more formidable.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/582460/extras/Divider_Cool.png?t=1508016240\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>Tactical Fighting Game</u><br>Epitaph's combat system is real-time, cooldown-based combat fought on a linear board.
