The quality of the add-on is superb, the general standard of modelling very good, and with the animated extras to bring the place to life, Zurich is a great place to fly from and to. If you are using photo scenery for the area as a background, then the blending is excellent, whilst using UHD mesh, V3 also blends well, though there is a performance drop if you do use it. It is an airport which shows off what X-Plane 10 can do.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://mutleyshangar.com/reviews/jess/bs-lszh/bs-lszh.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://mutleyshangar.com/reviews/jess/bs-lszh/bs-lszh.htm</a><br>",
