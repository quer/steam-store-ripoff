He collects 'luxury tax' from every bootlegger and scofflaw in town. Shaking down the newly opened speakeasy should've been simple, but instead, Jack and his men uncover a clan of vampires hell bent on taking over the town. Prohibition has proven very profitable for corrupt cops like Jack Malone. He collects 'luxury tax' from every bootlegger and scofflaw in his small town. Shaking down the newly opened speakeasy should've been simple, but instead, Jack and his men uncover a clan of vampires hell bent on taking over the town. Ice-T (Law &amp; Order SVU) plays Chesterfield, an ancient vampire, and Michael McFadden (Into the Lion's Den) plays Jack Malone in this action thriller set in 1933 - a time in history where common citizens break the law, hide in the shadows, operate at night. This environment of corruption and secret lives, is an ideal setting for vampires to hide in plain sight. They run a popular speakeasy, infiltrate the local whore house and feast on unsuspecting victims. When Jack and his corrupt cops poke around the speakeasy, they discover the vampires among their midst. Now Chesterfield and his coven must hide their secret, forcing them to act. The bloody result leaves several killed and others prisoner, awaiting a fate worse than death. With no where else to turn, Jack joins forces with a busboy and crazy preacher to save the innocent and make a final stand against Chesterfield and his vampires.",
