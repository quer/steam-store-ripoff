It will run without a headset connected, or via the non-vr launch option, and has control methods added to support non-vr play, but support is not completed and the gamepad tutorial will not be fully applicable. See notes for version 0.95. I've had significant interest in a Non-VR version, so I have been adding support to do this and I'm at a point where people just need to try it.</p><br><h1>Note for HTC Vive users...</h1><p>This application was originally made for the Oculus Rift and Touch controllers, and has been adapted for the HTC Vive, or any compatible headset, through OpenVR.  It should auto-detect Oculus and Vive headsets, and give appropriate instructions.  However, if you are presented with the wrong information, there are launch options in SteamVR and your normal Steam Library to override and force Vive or Oculus VR types if required.</p><br><h1>If you have the Oculus Home version of Aquila ...</h1><p>... then I can issue you with a complimentary key for Aquila on Steam. If anything the simulator runs much smoother in OpenVR, so I can recommend it. Please get in touch.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Have you dreamed of what it would be ... to soar like an eagle?</strong><br><br>Aquila Bird Flight Simulator lets you experience soaring bird flight using virtual reality.  It was originally designed for the Oculus Rift, but has now been modified for OpenVR.  You embody one of three species of eagle flying over either Northwest Scotland, a part of Columbia, or Graham Island in British Columbia. This is designed as a relaxing soaring flight simulation, and is not arcade-style flight, and as such you can make use of ridge lift and thermals.  If you want a work out try flapping with motion controllers!<br><br>Proceeds from this project go towards a major bird of prey centre in Hampshire (UK), where I do voluntary work. Supporting this project helps towards vital conservation, rehabilitation, and education schemes throughout the UK and overseas.  So on behalf of the birds, and the staff, thank you! <br><br><strong>Main Features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dude you're an eagle!
