The main thrust of these rants is characteristically anti-western but there was a hint of something big that intelligence communities are taking seriously. True to form, both a successful missile launch and a Nuclear test on the same day startled the world. <br><br>A few days later, catching most intelligence agencies by surprise, North Korea’s first Ballistic Missile Capable submarine – the Sinpo sortied from the naval base at Mayang-do. All previous sorties have been highly choreographed events involving missile test firing.  Satellite imagery produced by the US National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) shows the submarine simply leaving port under the cover of darkness and it has not been seen or detected since. Worrisome as that event is, there is significant evidence that two NK-11 Nodong 2 missiles were removed from the Chungjinsi Nuclear Storage site on 18 February, and the missile launchers for these missiles have not been seen in several weeks.<br><br>Under pressure from Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia, the UN Security Council was moved into action.
