Choose your side and let the dying/saving begin!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>It's Check Out Time!</strong></h2>As a retiree, you will need to craft lethal weapons of self-destruction out of ordinary items and hide yourself while attempting suicide. But beware: Saviors are looking for you and they're determined to save you from certain death.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Life Is <i>Precious</i>!</strong></h2>As a Savior, your job is keeping the Suiciders alive by finding the correct life-saving tool for any situation and using that on whoever is dying. Sedate the old-timers and conduct them into containment rooms to prevent suicide and instantly earn your score.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Power-up your job</strong></h2>Look well around and find incredible items to either get special abilities if you are playing as a Savior, or instantly kill yourself if you are playing as a Suicider. Magic potions, teleport devices, a barrel of fireworks, a blow up doll...<br><br><br>Every match lasts a few minutes and fast thinking is everything. Any time a Suicider dies or is confined, points are assigned determining the winning party at the end of the match.
