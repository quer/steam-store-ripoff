More recently, the scheme has started to appear on Amtrak's GE Dash 8 locomotives, new switcher locomotives, as well as EMD F40PH 'Cabbage' NPCU (non-powered control unit) cab cars. There is no 'wave' on the 'cabbages'. Phase V has not appeared on any passenger cars. Amtrak has decided to keep the Phase IV stripes with the introduction of the Phase IVb paint scheme.
