            "detailed_description": "Chowdertwo is a game about Chowderchu, a space-dwelling, beard-wielding, Wizard who harnesses the power of Chowd and might to overcome his obstacles. After a hiatus of indeterminable length, Chowderchu has returned to the spotlight after his victorious debut in the first Chowderchu game. This new adventure features an upgraded moveset with unlockable abilities which you will need when facing off against an army of bosses and challenges. The physics of Chowderspace have been fine-tuned since the first conquest, and now Chowderchu dances like a graceful, bearded marionette past any encumbrance- assuming that the player is a Wizard and not a mere human. There is action, adventure, romance, and online dating- what more could one ask for? A resume game feature, you say? It has that as well. Step up to the challenge and play Chowdertwo today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a challenging game with a unique play-style involving the mouse and keyboard. Creative problem-solving is essential and there are many different ways of approaching each level.",
