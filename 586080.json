Pick up your weapons, choose your classes (Mage, Archer, Warlock, Priest), team up with other players, and banish evil demons to protect the world!<br><br><strong>Game Feature</strong><br>•\tExtensive team cooperation and strategy<br>•\tUnique and diverse classes and skills<br>•\tChallenging and intriguing raids<br>•\tInteraction with global players across different VR platforms<br>•\tLoot collection and character development<br>•\tActual physical body movements in VR<br><br><strong>Classes and skills</strong><br>Age of Heroes involves multiple classes: mage, warlock, archer, priest, and warrior. The uniqueness of the classes creates opportunities for strategy and teamwork between players. Each class has its own skill set and development. By choosing different skills, you can create your own play style and create a character that best fits your own strategy and personality.<br>At launch, 4 classes will be available:<br><br><strong>Mages</strong> are noble masters of the element power from the Energy Source. Mages can deal powerful Area of Effect (AoE) and slow enemies attacks. <br><br><strong>Archers</strong> are professionally-trained fighters who shoot volleys of arrows upon their foes. The faster the arrows are shot, the more damage they can inflict.<br><br><strong>Warlocks</strong> can summon mighty golems. Warlocks are drawn to the dark side of the Energy Source. They have mastered the way of fighting demons. <br><br><strong>Priests</strong> are the key supporters in a team. Their healing and resurrection skills are crucial in raids. <br><br><strong>After launch</strong>, we will add the warrior class:<br><strong>Warriors</strong> are tanks and have massive defensive abilities. Warriors are best suited for near or middle range attacks. <br><br><strong>Challenging and intriguing raids</strong><br>At launch, there will be 3 different raids: Hall of Death, Freezing Stronghold, and Fort of Horror. <br>Each raid contains battles and bosses that require team cooperation and different raid strategies. <br><br><strong>Actual body movements</strong><br>In Age of Heroes, you need physical body movements like ducking or quick dodging to avoid darts and boss special abilities. Age of Heroes adapts for different room sizes, you can set different game configurations to complete all tasks with just slight movements for small rooms or change the configuration to use big movements for larger rooms.<br>Physical movements are triggered when you see the alert on the ground or hear the NPC voice alert, then you know it’s time to react. <br><br><strong>Loot and character development</strong><br>Players have a chance to loot scrolls that permanently enhance the skills of heroes after each battle. With different skill builds and team strategies, every single combat is a new fight. For example, the healing skill scroll will transform priest’s healing skill from individual healing into group healing. This change frees your teammates from frequent hit-and-run so they can focus more on attack. Talk to your teammates to make team combat fun and effective! <br><br><strong>Play with heroes worldwide</strong><br>Age of Heroes includes single-player mode and multiplayer mode. In multiplayer mode, you may set up your own game or join an existing game. Each game allows a party of up to 5 players.<br>The more players there are, the more difficult the game becomes!<br>in addition, Age of Heroes supports cross-platform co-op. You can play it with players using either Vive or Oculus Rift.<br>Also, you can use build-in audio chatting system to communicate with your teammates if your VR gear supports audio inputs.<br><br><strong>DLCs in the future</strong><br>New class DLC coming soon:<br>A new class, warrior, will be added soon after launch. Warrior is the symbol of courage, loyalty and justice. They fight enemies in the front of the battle line and protect teammates by shields.
