The Outpost is a key to the defense of the elven homeland, for from it messages are sent to the lords of that people, keeping them abreast of all that the orcs do. It is only lightly defended, for the orcs have not gathered in great numbers since the fall of the Horned God, so many years ago.<br><br>That is about to change. Under their warlord, Grom, they are massing, plotting to overwhelm the Outpost and plunge their arms into the lands of the Fontenouq, crushing the elves in a series of rapid battles, before they can gather their scattered peoples.<br><br>The elves at the Outpost, longer used to calm and quiet, know nothing of this, and unless news is brought to them quickly, they and many of their people will fall beneath the ravages of Grom and his host of ravage, wild-eyed Uthine warriors.</i><br><br>Released on January 30, 2017.
