Jonathan also devotes himself to looking after his father Burghardt, who has cancer. But his father stubbornly sabotages all of his son’s efforts tp care for him. Jonathan finds it increasingly difficult to cope until they hire a young caretaker, Anka, to help. Jonathan and Anka fall in love; her experience of working at a hospice helps Jonathan to gain a new insight into his father’s situation.\r\n\r\nBut then Burghardt’s long-lost boyhood friend Ron appears on the scene and his health visibly improves. The family sees Ron as an intruder; then Jonathan discovers that, many years ago, his father and Ron were deeply in love.
