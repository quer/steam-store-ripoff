You play as a stranger whose life story is represented in the form of a maze from which you cannot find a way out, but rather have to invent it yourself.<br><br>Every fork in the maze corresponds to a situation in the hero's life. An exit from there means that the situation has been resolved. Going through the maze and choosing which path to take builds the story of the character. The choice is made by solving a puzzle, as there can be several solutions to the same problem. By performing a certain action, you open the corresponding path and leave the fork, changing the history of your hero. <br><br><strong>Choose your path and see where it leads you.</strong><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Nonlinear plot that you create yourself<br></li><li>Abstract and relaxing visualization with pleasant music from Blue Dot Sessions<br></li><li>Unusual game plot and puzzles provide a fresh look at real-life situations<br></li><li>There are multiple outcomes possible which will make you want to go through the game more than once</li></ul>",
