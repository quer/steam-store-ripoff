A powerful finishing blow can rip a part of the enemy right out of him, while critically over damaging an opponent literally blows them to pieces, with limbs flying across the room and sticking to the walls.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/596240/extras/4_game_en.png?t=1525068409\" ><br>You control the Arbiter, once a person of a high rank in Xilai religious hierarchy.
