After fighting off the people who killed your only family you find yourself having nothing left but the two hands in front of you.<br> <br>The world is quickly taking a darker turn. People will die, blood will lay ways to the surface of the orange, gray earth. The world will burn under your feet as the people around you fear you. You are John, a man with a cliche name and a hidden story of ethics. You don't care, you control someone with no morals and he will do anything. John... he will burn the world down, break every bone, slaughter every child, and find his truth. Do you want to know what happens in the end? John dies. Everyone dies in the end, it's just the hard truth.
