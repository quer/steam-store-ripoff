Zooming through gorgeous landscapes, utilising a traditional isometric construction mode and mastering a unique board game-like gameplay, you'll find yourself immersed in the task of building your own transport empire.<br><br>The goal is to create your own transport empire on a procedurally generated map.<br><br>The game is a unique blend of realistic graphics combined with an isometric construction mode and boardgame-like rules.<br><br>Players start the game in control of a transport company. They must lay tracks on difficult terrain, research and buy new vehicles, manage routes and compete against economic rules to make as much profit as possible by transporting passengers and various cargos. This makes for a challenging simulation game requiring the player to consider all elements of business to be successful.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/598960/extras/cap0.jpg?t=1550275546\" ><br>Players can switch to an isometric construction mode inspired by the very best strategy classics. This is a grid based map where every change of traffic layout is a rewarding puzzle. You can build simple tracks connecting just two stations, or design sophisticated networks using junctions and signals to maximize efficiency and performance.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/598960/extras/cap1.jpg?t=1550275546\" ><br>As the game progresses, you’ll need to extend and customize your transport empire. You can upgrade industry buildings, stations and depots in various ways, and improve your trains using new engines and special wagons. Each upgrade offers a unique bonus; greater capacity, new processing rules and even new cargo types.

You can exit construction mode at any time to dive back into the beautiful landscapes and detailing of the 3D world.

As EA progresses, we will introduce more eras so in the future, you’ll progress from the Age of Steam through the modern world and into the future. You’ll encounter new industries and vehicles in each era. Villages will grow to become cities, new infrastructure and upgrades will become available. It is up to you how you use these new features to build your transport empire. From humble beginnings, you’ll build a vast transport network using everything from steam power while moving cargo like coal and wood to - will be introduced to the game in the future - maglev supertrains delivering futuristic electronics.",
