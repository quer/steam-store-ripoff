In order to pierce the Corona, the teams must first gather strength by mining a resource called <strong>Salt</strong>​.<br><br><strong>Salt</strong>​ is used to crystallize new tools and weapons. Players fight for control of Salt beds scattered throughout the level, which produce <strong>Salt​ ​crystals</strong>​ periodically. By relaying Salt back to the base and dissolving it in the Well, the Heart grows in strength, and the Band gains access to more powerful tools and weapons. Under the protective cover of the final tool, the <strong>Censer</strong>, Shards can enter the Corona and strike at the enemy heart!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Torchwave Locomotion System</h2><br><i>Light Strike Array</i> features an original locomotion system called <strong>Torchwave</strong>​. Each map is broken into a series of <strong>Cells</strong>​, hexagonal platforms under 2 meters across.

If the throw is true, the Shard phases out of reality. Now intangible, the player is invisibly teleported to the destination. When the torch arrives, the Shard rematerializes - but unless they <strong>turn around and catch​ ​the​ ​incoming​ ​Torch</strong>, they &quot;crash,&quot; leaving them momentarily defenseless!<br><br>A competitive game is only as deep as its movement system is robust—and VR locomotion is a brave new world. Light Strike Array tackles these challenges together: the teleportation-derived design <i>mitigates the risk of motion sickness</i>, and the physical act of throwing the torch <i>adds a natural skill cost</i> to long-range movement, incentivising players to mix teleportation and local movement.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tools and Weapons</h2><br>With each completed Pillar of Salt, the Heart forms new <strong>tools</strong>​ ​for the Band. <i>Light Strike Array</i> features a brilliant spectrum of tools and weapons, each with unique abilities <i>balanced around their physicality</i>. For example, a patient and precise Shard might take the <strong>Rod</strong>​ ​to intimidate and blast enemies from afar. A more agile and aggressive player might wield the <strong>Sword</strong>​, a close-range weapon with a wide variety of sweeping strikes. Naturally, for those looking for something more straightforward, there's always the <strong>Bow</strong>.<br><br>Not every tool is a weapon, however! The <strong>Vial</strong>​ is a portable reserve that dissolves and transports halite crystals in bulk. A catalyst for rapid Salt growth, its usefulness is only limited by your skill with the Torch.
