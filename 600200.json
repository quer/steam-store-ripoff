Smintheus feels like it benefits from the *pedigree* of that era, if that makes any sense.  It’s worth a look, very worthy of the title “computering game”. There seems to be something distinctly pretty about it, hard to describe”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/04/21/free-games-of-the-week-10/#comments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>“If you’re in for a simple and cute little indie puzzler, Smintheus is worth a try. It features gorgeous artwork with easy puzzles and the element of exploration. Crafting and survival elements are also used lightly throughout the game so it feels almost like an RPG.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://peachscastle.com/games/adventure/smintheus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Peach's Castle</a><br>",
