In a corner of the empire, a young man is about be caught up in the flames of war.  His name is Iwata Soroku. He's lazy, a philanderer, and he hates war.  He's about as far from a soldier as you can get.\r\n\r\nOn his way towards the next stage of officer's qualification exams, he and his childhood friend Yatorishino Igsem encounter the nurse trainee Harouma Beckle, Mashuu Tetrijirch, a member of the old military faction, and Torwey Lemion.  Torwey is a scion of the house of Lemion, which is one of the &quot;Three Loyal Houses&quot;, like Yatori's family. They're enjoying themselves aboard the ship they're traveling on, when suddenly it runs aground.  \r\n\r\nThe order is given to evacuate, but then Iwata sees a girl about to fall into the sea.  He jumps into the raging storm after her, and grabs her tiny hand. It is the 905th Year of the Imperial Calendar.  This was the first encounter between the Empire’s last princess, and the &quot;Always-Lazy, Always-Victorious General&quot;. This was the start of their journey towards &quot;The Promised Defeat&quot;.",
