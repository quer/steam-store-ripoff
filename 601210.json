But it ain't so. There's no possible way you could see that, because this game has no graphics. It's totally an old school text adventure. Except for, umm... the graphics. Which you sort of point to and click on... instead of typing (wink).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou probably think you're going on an epic adventure to far away places of filled with mystery and intrigue. You won't encounter terrible beasts, nefarious traps and mindbending puzzles. Those things will never happen. Except that it IS going to happen. All of that and more awaits, in the highest resolution graphics you've never seen, all without graphics. Sort of... look, it's hard to explain until you lean in and really see it. Just get your keyboard and mouse ready, and prepare to click your way deep into the dungeon empire!",
