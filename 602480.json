From the cute but creepy decor, to the large trap elements that would be small items in everyday use, to the constant prying eyes of Sven through his cameras. Not to mention the skulking enemy contraptions that slink around almost every corner. Everything works together seamlessly to create a world that pulls you into its tiny clutches.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://vrthegamers.com/kartong-death-by-cardboard-review-sneaking-around-childhood-nightmare/#.WtfU54hua71\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Arline Groenewald, VRTheGamers</a><br>",
