Edit it!<br />\r\nStunt Island sets the new standard for simulations, combining a first-rate flight simulator with an extraordinary Hollywood film-making module. Play Stunt Island as a campaign, where you compete 32 challenging stunt flying assignments. Or let your imagination run wild as you create your own action-packed films!<br />\r\nStunt Island was developed with the assistance of top Hollywood producers, stunt coordinators, set designers and pilots. It's the only flight simulator offering you a &quot;crash course&quot; on Hollywood! <br />\r\n• Do things you've never done before with a flight simulator - land on moving trains, play &quot;chicken&quot; with a truck on a crowded street, or pluck an escaping convict off a tower on Alcatraz Island.<br />\r\n• Choose any of 45 carefully crafted military and civilian aircraft, beautifully rendered with Gouraud shading.<br />\r\n• Fly in the stunt competition, or create and fly your own stunts.<br />\r\n• Position up to 8 cameras to capture all the action. Place cameras on moving cars or even in a spotter place, using your pan and zoom to stay right with the scene.<br />\r\n• Choose the location. Stunt Island is a huge self-contained 3-D world featuring 34 pre-built sets (large cities, small towns, a castle, LAX, a canyon, and more). Or build your own set from an inventory of more than 800 objects, famous landmarks and vehicles.<br />\r\n• Set vehicles in motion, trigger explosions, fire missiles... you have complete control over all the action.<br />\r\n• With film footage in hand, head for the editing facility, where you'll cut and splice the best camera angles into your action-packed film.<br />\r\n• Add music, sound, optical effects, credits, even your own voice-over (requires a compatible sound card).<br />\r\n• Existing stunts come with an auto edit feature to help you learn the ropes.<br />\r\n• Then, set the date for your Hollywood premiere!",
