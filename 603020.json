Instead of immediately losing health when the player is hit, they will loose &quot;Guard points&quot; (which function like a regeneration shield). When these run out, the player will take damage normally. However, if the player accurately dodges through incoming attacks, they will turn a large portion of that attack damage into &quot;Guard points&quot;, which allows you to turn the tide of the fight, and gain the upper hand. This is a system that will allow anyone to get into the game, yet still provide a high skill ceiling for those players looking for a challenge.<br><br>Players can also take advantage of a reflective shield; capable of turning most enemy projectiles into &quot;friendly&quot; ones, so you can strike back with the enemy's own weapons. While this will not regenerate Guard, it <i>will</i> still negate attacks at a lesser Guard cost.<br><br>With eight different stats to spec into (along with stat reallocation), countless varieties of character builds are possible.
