            "detailed_description": "<strong>SINISTRY SILINIUM</strong> is a psychological horror game with action, stealth, and puzzle elements. You will encounter intriguing story of the main character in a small town where experiments with sound waves have caused the whole population to become more or less insane and turn into various kinds of psychiatric patients. Your goal is not just to get out of the place alive, but also to face several weighty moral choices that will make a difference to the final ending. Because many of the people you meet will pose no mortal danger: sometimes you will be able simply to pass them by, if their acquired mental disturbances do not make them aggressive. Avoiding murdering them doesn't only save rounds: it also opens up location-related plot lines that are not available if your casualty count is very high. But you won't find it easy to tell at a glance what is going on in each resident's head, so tension and uncertainty will be your permanent companions all the way through the game. In addition, you will also visit surrealistic scenes created by the main character's hallucinations: he too has experienced the same fate as the local residents.<br><br><strong>Game features:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>- deep atmosphere,<br></li><li>- unusual plot,<br></li><li>- interactive environment,<br></li><li>- physical interaction with objects,<br></li><li>- different paths through the game,<br></li><li>- several endings,<br></li><li>- elements of surrealism.</li></ul><br>Demo on IndieDB <a href=\"http://www.indiedb.com/games/sinistry-silinium/downloads/sinistry-silinium-demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://www.indiedb.com/games/sinistry-silinium/downloads/sinistry-silinium-demo</a>",
