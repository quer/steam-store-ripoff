Their roles vary from handing out parking tickets to chasing down dangerous suspects. They’ll do everything they can to prevent criminal activity and put a stop to any crimes in progress.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/605740/extras/PD.jpg?t=1548162667\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/605740/extras/Header_EMSSTEAM.png?t=1548162667\" ><br>As an emergency medical specialist, your job lies in keeping members of the public alive, treating patients’ injuries, diagnosis and more.

The fire department won’t engage in the pursuit of suspects, but will handle the aftermath of an incident, including, of course, putting out fires. Battling raging flames and freeing trapped civilians involves some heavy-duty gear including spreaders, a fire hose, a fire extinguisher and a fire truck.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/605740/extras/FD.jpg?t=1548162667\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MULTI-PLAYER</h2>Team up with fellow players online and divide your team between the three emergency services at will.
