Horror you have to reach out to and touch.</strong> Organ Quarter leverages hand-tracked and room-scale VR to provide the most intense and unsettling experience possible.The sense of physical space and presence unique to the VR medium is carefully leveraged, pushing players past their comfort zone, bringing them into tight, claustrophobic environments and making them get up close and personal with monsters (who may not always be hostile...).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How is Organ Quarter Unique?</h2><strong>This is not a wave shooter or a walking simulator – Organ Quarter is a long-form horror adventure.</strong> This is an experience that plays out over a large area <strong>over 5-8 hours</strong>, with intricately connected levels, gun combat, resources and tools at the player's disposal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story?</h2><strong>Uncover what has gripped and twisted the Organ Quarter.</strong> Over weeks and months of isolation in your apartment, something has happened to the city. It has become infected. Its places. Its people. Everything has become twisted by a disease that may or may not have a motive.
