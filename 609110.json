They survive in hiding while their hunters rule the surface. When a small rebel group gets an intel about a big AI's power plant, the machines strike their camp before they can organize an attack. A small group of rebels escape and go in a suicide mission to destroy this power plant. Choose to play as Mavra, a super badass human resistance soldier, or Doyle, the equally groovy and deadly insurgent robot. This suicide mission will result in heavy casualties and a ton of lock-and-load fast-paced action where scraping robots and blazing chrome with your powerful weapons is the only thing standing between you and your freedom.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/609110/extras/8.gif?t=1549879394\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/609110/extras/test_titre_steam_BC3.png?t=1549879394\" ><br><br>Dash through 5 apocalyptic environments with hundred of robots-enemies to blow to pieces.
