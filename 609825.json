Its ability to deliver nuclear weapons, despite having a limited range, made it a very effective deterrent in the early part of the Cold War. It was a very sleek and handsome aircraft, although the unswept wing and rather puny 4,000lb (later 5,200lb) thrust Allison turbojets meant it could only achieve 500 mph at 30,000ft. <br><br>The Tornado never saw action as a bomber, but the final version of the airframe, the RB-45C, was purely for reconnaissance.
