As the mystery unfolds, he finds himself plagued by haunting dreams that turn into an even more terrifying reality. Pieces of a complex, otherworldly puzzle begin to fall into place as Adam falls apart and his friend Grace desperately tries to hold him together. Searching the Internet, she finds eyewitness video by others who have heard the sounds. This database becomes a list of victims, who have all gone missing after hearing the skyquakes. Fearing she and Adam are next, the search to find the source of the sounds becomes a race against time before it finds them. Beautifully shot and hauntingly moving, Skyquake is an edge of your seat thriller, based on real life events, that far exceeds its humble statistics. Sacrificing nothing, audiences will be shocked that it was shot in only 10 days. With a talented cast and crew of less than 20, and for a budget far under most features' catering costs, Skyquake is a true testament to what indie film is all about, keeping audiences talking well after the credits have rolled.",
