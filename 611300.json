After a UE4 map is uploaded using our built-in workshop tool, modders can create their own custom lobby and add any subscribed workshop maps to the server map list.</p><br><h1>Controller Support</h1><p>All controller sensitivities, deadzones, and buttons are customizable through the in-game menu. There’s also support for creating controller-only rooms. This removes the ability to use a mouse and restricts input to joysticks only. The controller-only option is available when creating a custom server and will display a special icon in the server browser.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Task Force is a tactical shooter that focuses on close quarters infantry combat. It aims to provide competitive arcade-style gameplay inspired by classic third-person games. Maps will include locations around the world where special operations are conducted. These could be jungles, deserts, urban areas or snowy environments. They'll be designed around single-life game modes with mechanics involving either bombs, hostages, or intel.<br><br>There are NO plans to include any of the following in Task Force:<br>- NO Health Regeneration<br>- NO Weapon Unlocks<br>- NO Enemy Targeting (UAV)<br>- NO Character Progression<br>- NO Killstreaks, Deathstreaks, or Perks<br>- NO Drivable Vehicles (Coop Only)<br>- NO Unrealistic Skins<br><br><strong>TACTICAL THIRD-PERSON GAMEPLAY</strong><br>Gameplay focuses on close quarters infantry combat where communication and teamwork are required. Expanding crosshairs provide a sense of weapon inaccuracy which is affected by recoil, stance, movement, and a few other factors. It rewards bursting by keeping tighter shots more precise while still allowing for accurate spray.<br><br><strong>STRATEGIC ROUND-BASED GAME MODES</strong><br>Game modes are round-based and mostly focus on single-life objectives. They’ll involve aspects such as planting or defusing bombs, extracting or guarding hostages, and capturing or defending intel. Each map will be designed to a specific game mode but may also have different areas sectioned off for different modes.<br><br><strong>COMPETITIVE LEAGUES AND RANKINGS</strong><br>Automated ladders and tournaments are integrated directly into the game. Players are provided with a detailed stats profile and a global ranking based on competitive performance. Servers are automatically created for scheduled matches and will instantly report game information upon match completion.<br><br><strong>CUSTOM USER-CREATED LOBBIES</strong><br>Servers are organized based on region and players have the ability to create their own lobbies directly in-game. These custom lobbies provide access to a robust set of management tools such as restricting players to friends-only or clan-only. It also allows for region-locking servers and automatically kicking high ping players.",
