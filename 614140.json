A place where death lurks past every corner and where patience and expertise will be your best allies.<br><br>The Prophecy has been fulfilled, and the Puppet Master has emerged from the void; a being capable of corrupting the worlds he encounters with its mere presence, turning living beings into abominations that attack and kill everything within reach while he gains power.<br><br>As Keeper of the Flame, you must protect the kingdom of Illusoria, its inhabitants and Amelia, its empress. To achieve this, you must acquire the power of the Guardian throughout your adventure in order to defeat the Puppet Master and his host of monsters. Time is against you and the Empress is counting on you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features and Gameplay:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The player will have the chance to play at his own pace throughout the story and as your power increases so will your combat prowess.
