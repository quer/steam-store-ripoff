By the charge of a powerful and benevolent deity, six holy knights were bestowed with an artifact of tremendous power. Wielding the relic known as the lucespel, the order vanquished Tenebrash and light was returned to the weary world. The knights bound the vengeful spirit of the dragon within their stronghold, and sacrificed their own mortality to eternally guard the artifact from those who would misuse its power. With the return of evil to the realm, a new quest has been called: venture into the ruins of the ancient keep to retrieve the lucespel.
