The comic book visuals give the game a lot of personality and there’s a lot to be said for it’s streamlined take on the arena shooter in a market full of bloated, impenetrable messes. If you want to fiddle about with loot boxes, perks and weapon attachments play Call of Duty, but if you want an arena shooter that focuses on what really matters come join The Misfits.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.alphabetagamer.com/the-misfits-alpha-sign-up/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Alpha Beta Gamer</a><br>",
