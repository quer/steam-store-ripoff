Ciphers aren't a thing here, and local shoddy mystical beliefs are really irritating and dejecting to Roui. He dreams to return to his old life... But how can it be possible if you have no money? In search of quick earnings, Roui has picked up his old jewelry tools once more and seeks out customers himself. Roui’s latest customer has charged him with a task to make a bracelet from a special wood for his bride – due within a month! But, as soon as Roui gets to work, strange and unpleasant things start to appear. Which, due to the superstitions of the local people, became much more horrific and absurd than they actually are. Roui apparently isn't meant to finish the work on the bracelet... because it was stolen! An unexpected helper says that the bracelet was taken by the legendary Latorian spirit - the Mad Rook. Is the Rook real or is it just her sick imagination? Roui has no time to figure out the details - he has to believe the helper and start looking for the bracelet as soon as possible, all while incidentally deciphering the mysterious cryptograms he'll be facing along the way.<br>Will Roui succeed and get the bracelet back?
