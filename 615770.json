The ease of gameplay, clean and simple interface, the strength of the plot, the interesting scenery and choice of difficulty levels all contributed to my overall rating.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.uhs-hints.com/articles/reviews/ndrew3.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Universal Hint</a><br><br>“Ever since their games first came to my attention, I have been a staunch admirer of Her Interactive. I really like the fact that they design games for girls (that everyone can enjoy), with no stereotypes, no overt educational value, and absolute respect for girls’ intellectual abilities. A lofty goal to be sure, and well-met, but was Message in a Haunted Mansion actually fun? I think so! I had a great time playing it!”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.fourfatchicks.com/Reviews/Nancy_Drew_3/ND3.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >FourFatChicks</a><br><br>“Message in a Haunted Mansion scores especially high in the area of personal identification. Role playing is at the heart of the game. The user becomes Nancy, becomes an amateur sleuth, becomes the person peeking into suitcases and musty drawers.”<br>GirlsTech<br>",
