I recently went through my library of home movies and other videos that I had in digital format. Some of these videos were up to 15 years old and I couldn't play them properly on my modern electronics. Prism allows me to take just about any format and convert it to whatever I want. It also heightens the quality of the playback without bloating the file size of the project.”<br>5.0 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R1DQ5D3VD0A0RZ?ref=pf_vv_at_pdctrvw_srp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Amazon</a><br>",
