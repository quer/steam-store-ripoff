To my delight, PhotoPad accurately resolved this otherwise tricky process in one step, and allows me to batch correct to boot. It is worth it to me for this one feature, but offers a nice balance of other features that makes it part of my regular go=to photo processing toolkit.”<br>5.0 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/R1O0OYRLO67AX1?ref=pf_vv_at_pdctrvw_srp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Amazon</a><br>",
