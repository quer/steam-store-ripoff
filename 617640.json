Classless character building, strategic management, and small unit tactical gameplay combine to create a multi-layered experience that puts players in the middle of a civil war in a morally grey fantasy world.<br><br>A game of hard decisions and harsher consequences, Forged of Blood will challenge players to make decisions across every layer of the game.
