If you enjoy mysteries, visual novels or the art style presented on the game, I’m pretty sure you’ll enjoy this little gem.”<br>90 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://operationrainfall.com/2017/09/28/review-1bitheart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Operation Rainfall</a><br><br>“I loved my time spent in this goofy, sci-fi world. It wasn’t perfect, but it was a wonderful way to waste a few hours. If Miwashiba ever decides to grace us with any more of these delightfully odd little experiences in the future, you can bet your ass that I intend to play them.”<br>75 – <a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/review-1bitheart-465805.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br><br>“1bitHeart caters to a specific target audience, but what it does for this type of experience it does well. It takes about four hours to complete which feels like about the proper length for it. Solving mysteries and making friends is the goal Misane has for Nanashi, and watching him panic and squirm while awkwardly fumbling through conversations has a certain endearing and relatable charm to it.”<br>80 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/09/13/review-1bitheart/271351/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hardcore Gamer</a><br>",
