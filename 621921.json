Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Take control of pure power with the latest entry to our Pro Range! Created in exacting detail and with a variety of realistic operating features, the Norfolk Southern General Electric C39-8 is a six-axle (C-C), 390,000-pound, 3,900-horsepower locomotive capable of tying onto the heaviest unit coal trains, yet also able to hustle intermodal traffic. <br><br>A member of General Electric’s “Dash 8” locomotive line that featured advanced microprocessor control for efficiency and improved reliability and modular components for ease of maintenance, the C39-8 was constructed by GE from 1984 through 1987 and 161 units (including a slightly modified C39-8E model) were constructed. Far and away the largest customer for the C39-8 was Norfolk Southern, which purchased 114 C39-8s from 1984 through 1986.<br><br>The NS C39-8 as crafted by Virtual Rail Creations is an authentic re-creation of Norfolk Southern’s distinctive units, which were configured to primarily operate long-hood forward with a single bi-directional control stand. The husky GEs were both powerful and resilient, and C39-8s served Norfolk Southern for a quarter-century before being retired in 2009.<br>The Norfolk Southern C39-8 is packed with realistic operating features, including cold-start options, a detailed and interactive master controller and rear-of-cab control panel, working Head-of-Train and End-of-Train devices, and Pennsylvania Railroad-style cab signals. And the locomotive is provided in clean, weathered, and snow-dressed versions of the classic Norfolk Southern livery.<br><br>You want to put this big GE diesel to work, so the pack contains four career scenarios on the Train Simulator Horseshoe Curve route (route available separately). Along with the Norfolk Southern C39-8, this pack also includes a range of rolling stock, highlighted by NS’s innovative Triple Crown 53-foot RoadRailers in two variations (smooth-side and ribbed), as well as modern 2-bay covered hoppers in Norfolk &amp; Western and Southern liveries, and a Norfolk Southern 100-ton, three-bay coal hopper.<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2>Four career scenarios for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/65233\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Horseshoe Curve Route Add-On</a> are included: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The Hostler<br></li><li>The Grinder<br></li><li>Dynamic Help<br></li><li>Road Railed</li></ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/65233\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Horseshoe Curve Route Add-On</a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.</strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
