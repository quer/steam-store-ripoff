            "detailed_description": "Enjoy contemporary and challenging railroading in the spacious prairies of Alberta, Canada as the remarkable Canadian National Peace River route comes to Train Simulator!<br><br>Created by Milepost Simulations, the Canadian National Peace River route delivers the experiences of hauling lumber products, timber, grain, and mixed commodities across 40 route miles of demanding, scenic Canadian National trackage located in Northern Alberta, Canada.<br><br>Train Simulator’s Canadian National Peace River route is centered upon the town of Peace River, Alberta, and includes portions of the Canadian National Railway’s Peace River, Manning, and Daishowa Subdivisions. The southern end of the Train Simulator Canadian National Peace River route is at Judah, located high on the Alberta prairie. From Judah to Grimshaw, via Peace River and Roma Junction, the route re-creates much of the CN Peace River Subdivision. From Roma Junction to nearby Roma Yard, the route replicates a key element of the CN Manning Sub, and from Michaud (on the west bank of the Peace River), the route fully re-creates the modern and rugged 10-mile Daishowa Subdivision to Peace Valley. <br><br>The included rail lines provide the Canadian National Peace River route with both main line tonnage and robust lineside tonnage sources, including grain elevators and loading facilities at Grimshaw, and a modern and expansive lumber mill at Peace Valley. Handling main line tonnage on the Canadian National Peace River route is a guarantee of challenging railroading. The line between Judah and Peace River involves a tortuous 2.4 percent grade linking the river valley and high prairie. The work west of the river is demanding, too; climbing from Michaud to Roma involves a gradient of over 2 percent and use of a double-horseshoe to gain elevation. <br><br>The Canadian National Peace River route includes locomotives and rolling stock ideally suited to serve on the line. The featured locomotive is Canadian National’s six-axle, 3,000-horsepower SD40-2W. Based on Electro-Motive’s standard SD40-2, the SD40-2W features the Canadian “comfort cab,” a design which includes a full-width and strengthened nose, more spacious crew cab, and distinctive four-piece windshield. The SD40-2W is provided in two CN liveries, the railway’s current livery and CN’s earlier “zebra stripe” livery. Featured freight equipment includes Canada’s classic cylindrical-design covered grain hoppers in two well-known liveries; boxcars in two liveries; center-beam and bulkhead lumber flats; and a Canadian National-design steel cupola caboose. And to put you right to work hauling tonnage and handling switching duties, the route also features a selection of six career scenarios which provide realistic operating experiences across the entire 40-mile route. <br> <br>Explore the great prairie and river country of Canada and master a range of locomotive skills with the Canadian National Peace River route!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2>The Canadian National Peace River route includes six highly authentic and challenging career scenarios that take you across the 40-mile length of the railroad:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Winter Work Train<br></li><li>Peaceful Morning Part 1<br></li><li>Peaceful Morning Part 2<br></li><li>Peaceful Morning Part 3<br></li><li>Peaceful Morning Part 4<br></li><li>Peaceful Morning Part 5</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
