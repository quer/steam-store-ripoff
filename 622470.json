Imagine how a classic MMORPG would look on an old arcade machine — Road Dogs is our fantasy in this theme. Our goal is to create a live PVP-world, something like 2D EVE Online, using the trends of recent years as elements of .io-games, and their minimalism, arcade similarity in particular.<br><br><br>Road Dogs takes place in the state of Arizona, set in the aftermath of a nuclear war. The planet has gone into hibernation during the darkness of the post-nuclear winter. Transportation between cities and towns is only possible in hermetically equipped vehicles. Voices carried by radio waves have replaced human faces. The dim light of the instrument cluster under the windshield has replaced the sun. And fuel is now worth more than blood. It’s the only source of life in such a world. Fuel is the new solar warmth and the engine of the economy. And here we are forced to deal with Nukeoil Corporation.<br><br>Before the global war, the entire US territory was covered with protected underground fuel storage facilities for potential land hostilities and wide maneuvers by US military forces. However, this never happened, and the storage facilities were taken under control by Nukeoil Corporation, which only distributes fuel in exchange for its Nucoins crypto currency, thus becoming the monopoly and center of the new world economy in the dark traditions of cyberpunk and retro futurism of the 1980s.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A seamless open world!</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/622470/extras/visit_towns.png?t=1513766123\" ><li>You can move the camera's position into the stratosphere with one roll of the mouse wheel.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Real time battles!</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/622470/extras/damage_map_weapon.png?t=1513766123\" ><li>Unpredictable PVP with no limits on the number of participants.
