Ahead of Mulaka’s release on early 2018, we set out to do just that with the launch of a three-part video series entitled “Behind Mulaka.”<br><br>Aptly named “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/986XvM3IQNg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >The Tarahumara Culture</a>”, the series’ first chapter, available now, acts as a primer of this indigenous peoples’ history and renown. From their incredible stamina and “superhuman” long-distance running talents, to the beautifully iconic geography they call home, get a glimpse into the cultural heart that beats through Mulaka.<br><br>The second chapter of “Behind Mulaka”, also available now, is titled &quot;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/mSLfNMG-Pog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >The Mythological Creatures</a>&quot; and shines a spotlight on the myths and legends of the Tarahumara, focusing on the fantastic creatures that are in the game.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/623640/extras/MulakaBehindTheScenesCh1Thumbnail_300Steam.jpg?t=1546470522\" ></p><br><h1>Soundtrack available on Soundcloud</h1><p>Music is a key element to achieve the full indigenous experience of the Tarahumara. That's why the music of Mulaka was created to be as authentic to the sounds of an indigenous soundtrack as possible by using traditional instruments.<br><br>We're uploading tracks of Mulaka's soundtrack to our Soundcloud and YouTube. Steam's restrictions don't allow us to include the links here, but you can find us on Soundcloud as LienzoMx and on YouTube as Lienzo Mx. They're free to listen and download, we want everyone to enjoy this very important part of our game.
