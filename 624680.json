That's the core concept behind UK indie developer Byron Atkinson-Jones' upcoming shooter Promethium.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/08/07/depression-inspired-shooter-promethium-heading-to-switch-this-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>“Side-scrolling shmup with some sweet cel-shaded art and a nice line in really gigantic-feeling spaceships in the background, in a way that reminds me faintly of the Red Dwarf intro credits. It’s fairly straightforward, being unashamedly a C64-inspired shmup rather than a wild and weird J-shmup-inspired piece, but that means it can get on with cranking up the difficulty and being a pure test of skill rather than bamboozling you with mechanics.  Speaking as someone who only has occasional relationships with shmups and as such isn’t particularly motivated by difficulty, I did find it perhaps a little samey level-to-level, but it’s tight and I do love the model spaceship-like look.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/08/24/steam-best-games-august-2017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br>",
