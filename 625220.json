You play as a young man who dares to take on tricky building that will challenge all of your skills and craft. In competition with other players you'll earn experience and points which you can use to rise up in ranks and earn trophies.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/625220/extras/glas2.jpg?t=1512352525\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BUILDINGS</h2>At first the buildings are easy to rebuild. But the deeper you get into the game, the more demanding the buildings will be and the bulkier the blocks will be. Only true master builders will be able to overcome all of these challenges.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/625220/extras/glas3.jpg?t=1512352525\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CONSTRUCTION PLANS</h2>The blueprint of the current level is always visible in the background. This is the required state of the building to allow it to be approved. The plan also shows how the coloured blocks should be positioned. At easy difficulty this plan is only a rough outline, it allows some deviations at positioning the blocks. On the other side there's the hard difficulty: here the building has to fit the plan exactly. Both the position and the colour patterns have to match.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/625220/extras/glas4.jpg?t=1512352525\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE BLOCKS</h2>The blocks of Building blocks come in many different shapes and colors. This diversity of blocks renders every newly achieved building a intriguing experience. Handles and weights differ from block to block. Movable and fixed blocks, simple and complex shapes, columns, letters and varying materials such as wood and stone will make every building a challenge.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/625220/extras/Gesichter.jpg?t=1512352525\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/625220/extras/AlleSteine.jpg?t=1512352525\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">BLOCK HANDLING</h2>Every block has differing qualities that require different handling. Complex shaped blocks and sometimes strange gravity change the handling of some blocks, making the construction of some buildings even more challenging. The whole game is played using the PC mouse. You grab a block exactly at that position by clicking on it with the left mouse button. But the block still obeys gravity! Aside from the grabbed place the block will continue falling and swinging. You have to take the block's shape and mass into account before trying to move it.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/625220/extras/glas5.jpg?t=1512352525\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Mode</h2> <strong>NORMAL GAME</strong><br>A normal game is played without time measurement. Just tinker with the blocks and enjoy experimenting. Unfortunately you're not allowed to enter the highscore lists in this mode.<br><strong>TIMED GAME</strong><br>In this game mode you're playing against the time. Try to solve the level before time runs out.

A new window opens which allows you to enter your name. After clicking on &quot;Accept&quot; the new player now shows up in the player list. You start the game with a simple click at the desired player name. To delete a player you need to right-click it.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/625220/extras/maus-linksrot.png?t=1512352525\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/625220/extras/glas7.jpg?t=1512352525\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MAP</h2>A beautiful map of Ancient Egypt shows all the various buildings. You can always view other sections of the map if scrolling is enabled at the top of the screen. By touching the gems at the map with your mouse you can get a preview of the building. You enter this building by left-clicking on it. Right-click on a gem shows the info screen explaining the meaning of the various gems.
