It is freely available on the Steam VR app store. With IRB consent we collect behavioral data and survey response questions in an Internet-connected immersive virtual environment. Our first alpha experiment involves simulated social scenes to measure social anxiety. This data will be used to create an empirical foundation for a free, automated intervention to treat social anxiety disorder. We also hope to open the platform to other researchers who can collected data with Unity-based environments in PsychLabVR. If you'd like to learn more, please contact Noah Robinson.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPsychLabVR will be updated with future experiments and free treatments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n**Loading times between scenes may take 1-5 minutes and the program may appear frozen.
