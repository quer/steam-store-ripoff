Visit the <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.strata.com/design-asset-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Design Asset Store</a> to browse the shop, or <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.strata.com/about-selling-design-assets-on-strata-com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >click here</a>  to see how you can submit your own designs. With your help, we'll be adding new design assets to the store daily!</p><br><h1>About the Software</h1>Strata Design 3D SE: The Perfect Way to Get Started<br><br>3D MODELING, TEXTURING &amp; RENDERING<br><br>If you’re just getting started, and don’t need animation and the latest in power that the CX version provides just yet, Design 3D SE is the perfect way to get started. With Design 3D SE you can learn the basics with a very capable tool.<br><br>MODEL WITH POWERFUL TOOLS<br><br>Every 3D image starts with a model, and SE gives you some key tools to get started – including polygon modeling, spline curves and Booleans. And you can bring in existing 3D assets – you’ll find a variety of import filters for third-party models and scenes.<br><br>APPLY SURFACE TEXTURES<br><br>Design 3D SE gives you some of the key texturing features you’ll need to produce quality work, including: Wrap any image around any 3D object; Give surfaces texture with bump and normal maps; Generate realistic metals with anisotropic maps; use polygon subset texturing and – more! And it’s easy to get started with the huge library of pre-made textures.<br><br>SET UP YOUR SCENE AND LIGHTING<br><br>Design 3D SE is like a photography studio where you have total control. Position your 3D objects and then place lights, reflection panels, cameras, backgrounds, environments and more to produce a quality final render.<br><br>RENDER PROFESSIONAL IMAGES<br><br>Design 3D SE’s renderer produces excellent results. From outlines, to toon-style rendering, to photo-realism – Design 3D SE can produce quality images fit for professional work.<br><br>CONNECT TO EVERYTHING ELSE<br><br>Several 2D and 3D file formats connect you to the rest of the world. This includes Collada files tailor-made for Apple’s iBooks Author app, OBJ, DXF and more. You can even 3D print with the included file formats that are accepted by desktop 3D printers and popular online 3D printing services.<br><br>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 3D UNIVERSITY<br><br>Strata offers a complete online training site that provides tutorials covering all aspects of the Design 3D line of products. This includes first time users to 3D professionals. It’s a great way to learn and is guaranteed to get you up to speed. Visit the University<br><br>YOU’RE READY TO STEP UP<br><br>Design 3D SE is a subset of its big brother, Design 3D CX. Once you’ve mastered Design 3D SE you’ll be ready to step up to CX without missing a beat. With Design 3D CX you’ll get an expanded toolset – including powerful modeling tools, UV texturing tools, animation, special effects and more.
