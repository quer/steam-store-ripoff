Booper likes to play and have fun; except while on vacation, Booper gets lost and needs to get back home. Help Booper solve puzzles, platform through an expansive, challenging world and explore a vast, colorful landscape straight from a child’s imagination. As the game progresses, the known world subtly morphs into a wild and fantastical microcosm created wholly from the drawings and paintings of the developer’s son. Explore multiple levels of whimsy and fun while collecting the items you’ll need to help Booper get back home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArt Style:<br />\r\nSince the developer is also a stay at home parent caring for 2 boys, the imagination of a child is a powerful lure for making a game. The landscape a kid navigates is filled with fantastical beings, heroes, wishes and the day to day stuff (including smelly socks!). The art style of a child screams to be animated and interacted with: it’s the end goal of any child’s creativity. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\nBooper Get Home! is a traditional platformer with a twist: Booper is a 2D character in a 3D world (with other 2D characters). The player controls and guides Booper to search and find all the items needed to solve puzzles and progress to the end goal of finding home. Along the way, Booper will meet many wild and vivid characters, avoid traps, pitfalls and dangers, as well as make a friend or two! <br />\r\nDevelopment Roadmap:<br />\r\nBooper Get Home! is currently under development for the HTC Vive, with plans to expand to Google Cardboard, OSVR and other VR platforms. Potential exists to port to Windows / Mac and SteamOS.  The final game is planned to be 15-20 hours of gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFuture plans include the addition of expansion packs and, based on feasibility, allowing parents to upload drawings done by their own children as a means to incorporate new art to modify the characters and props via a phone app.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther future plans (possibly a sequel) will allow for the player to interactively draw in the gameworld to help the player progress and solve problems.",
