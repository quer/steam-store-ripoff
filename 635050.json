Scrap can be found scattered about the environment - left by the miners who've long vacated the land. Their old silos are also still full of the stuff, so tear them apart with your weaponry and make it rain. Scrap is carried on the hull of your hovercraft where it absorbs damage, functioning like armour, but it's also heavy so the more you have the slower your vehicle will get.

Careful though, re-spawning costs your team some scrap, and if left unchecked you can find yourselves set back significantly if you feed the enemy too much.
