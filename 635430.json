Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either &quot;PARADE PASS&quot; or &quot;ASSAULT LANDING,&quot; with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an &quot;AILERON ROLL&quot; to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the &quot;DIAMOND ROLL,&quot; &quot;DELTA BREAK-OUT,&quot; and &quot;FLEUR DE LIS&quot; are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/635430/extras/airshow.png?t=1504003078\" ><br><strong>AIRSHOW</strong><br>Plan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore.

For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/635430/extras/BA_stripes_4.png?t=1504003078\" ><br><strong>ADDITIVE MODE</strong><br>Create aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off. Choose to fly in free formation or DIAMOND, DELTA, ECHELON, and LINE ABREAST and make spectacular combinations that you can relive with the use of multi-camera replays.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/635430/extras/BA_stripes_3.png?t=1504003078\" ><br><strong>EXPERIENCE AND SCORES</strong><br>Our trajectory detection system will tell you how accurate you are and the more precise you will be at all stages of the maneuver, the higher your score.
