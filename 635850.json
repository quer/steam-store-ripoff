The last world on the ragged frontier.<br><br>Twenty-five years after the People's Revolution, it's not uncommon for the few remaining androids to be consigned to isolated borderworlds such as this, far away from the core systems where anti-A.I. sentiment remains rife.<br><br>Largely despised and mistrusted by the very people they were built to serve, these androids do not have an easy existence – especially not when such a world turns out to be far more dangerous than could ever have been predicted.<br><br>Cryptic trails. Mysterious occurrences. Abnormal behaviour from droids and humans alike.<br><br>Perhaps there is more to this place than meets the eye.
