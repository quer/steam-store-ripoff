However, there may be more to this simple world of screens than what meets the eye, and this so-called developer may have motives of his own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n - Over 100 challenging levels – you will die. A lot.<br />\r\n - A peculiar story about facing the realities of life.<br />\r\n - Every level a puzzle – you must decipher the pattern behind each level to progress.<br />\r\n - An extraordinary original sound track by the amazingly talented Caleb Klomparens.<br />\r\n - Everything is synced with the music – use this to help get into the flow of the levels.<br />\r\n - A separate Free Play mode where you can try to play each chapter with the least amount of deaths and/or best time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFAQ:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ - Those colorful effects look cool, but they may be a bit much.<br />\r\nA - For those that are prone to seizures, or pro players who want a cleaner experience, a majority of the effects can be disabled in the Options menu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ - How many levels are there?<br />\r\nA - 103, 90 levels in the story plus 13 bonus levels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ - What is the estimated play time?<br />\r\nA - The average is about 3 hours. However, because the game is so difficult, play time can vary wildly from player to player. Some people have taken upwards of 6 hours, while the fastest we've seen someone beat it is 1 hour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ - Is there a way to just play through the levels without all of the story stuff?<br />\r\nA - Yes, you can play Free Play mode from the beginning, where story elements are disabled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ - The player character has a &quot;01&quot; on it, does that mean there will be multiplayer?<br />\r\nA - The &quot;01&quot; on the player is story related. There is currently no multiplayer. Multiplayer for Free Play mode was in the works for some time, but was cut due to time restraints. We *may* release it later on as a patch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nQ - Can I play this game on my Youtube or Twitch channel?<br />\r\nA - YES! Free marketing is always appreciated. Feel free to monetize the video too. Just make sure to link the Steam page in the description or in the video.",
