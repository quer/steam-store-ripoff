When you touch it, it starts to move and vanishes quickly in a dark corner.<br><br>Now you know what happened here... Creeps! That leaves you no choice, really. You will have to find them all, and kill them.

Face off hordes of Creeps with your repeater crossbow, a Ring of Detect Life, and a stack of explosive potions. Kill the Visitor Queen to finish the run and double your kills. <br><br>The real challenge of the Ripley Run is to carefully manage your resources and learn where to look for more in the overrun mining colony.
