We hope you'll enjoy this re-imagination of Malden, which is sure to bring back many memories of a certain flashpoint occurring on the island. Alongside the new terrain, this free DLC also delivers a new cooperative mode: Combat Patrol. Please enjoy the Malden DLC as a token of our appreciation to the best community in the world.

While Malden 2035 re-uses many vanilla Arma 3 structures, vegetation, and similar assets, it also includes additions such as colored buildings, vineyards, and barns. Malden 2035 was initially developed for Bohemia Interactive’s free tactical multiplayer shooter, Argo, and benefits greatly from Argo's infantry focus. A lot of effort was put into the gameplay flow of each location, and as such, this new version of Malden is ideal for Close Quarters Combat.<br></li><li>Combat Patrol<br>To (re)introduce Malden in a fun way, the Malden DLC comes with a completely new multiplayer mode, Combat Patrol. Combat Patrol is a quick and dynamic cooperative multiplayer mode in which you are a member of an infantry team with the possibility to select the Area of Operations. Each play-through will be different thanks to the mode's heavily randomized nature and behavior. If you want to experience authentic Arma gameplay, then Combat Patrol is a great starting point.
