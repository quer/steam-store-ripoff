As new products are released they can easily be added to the application without the need to reallocate physical space. Products can also be displayed in a variety of real world situations that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive or simply impossible to replicate in a physical showroom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nViewport meticulously recreated every material in 8K resolution, allowing users to get as close as possible to the floor without any degradation in visual quality. This high fidelity of surface materials is of paramount importance .",
