Share Super Multitasking with your friends, and watch as they excel...or don't!<br><br>Next, you can take on Challenge Mode!  It features 42 scripted Challenges that start off easy, but get tougher and tougher! You'll spend hours figuring out the best ways to navigate, attack, and finally conquer them! Can you get through all of them without breaking your controller? Try Speedrun Challenge Mode, which has you racing the clock to clear them all in one go!
