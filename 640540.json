The continent was divided into several regions, each with its own king. Though there were small skirmishes amongst them, a lord, chosen by the kings in conference, always maintained balance -- until the evil Black Army arrived.\r\n\r\n&quot;All will be engulfed in black.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Volunteer Army, led by Yuri, was no match for the Black Army. During the fighting, the Lord of Black captures half of the Chain Chronicle, as well as the capital. During their retreat, Yuri and the Volunteer Army encounter a boy fighting the Black Army all by himself.\r\nSo begins the story of the Chain Chronicle, of the Volunteer Army's and Black Army's battles for the fate of the world, and of friendship.",
