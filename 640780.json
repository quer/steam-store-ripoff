To do that, they must aim their shots accurately by calculating the initial speed and angle the projectile needs in order for its trajectory to hit nothing but their target, all that while accounting for the wind, gravity, and other player’s abilities. Strategy is key, communication is essential, and explosions are a lot of fun. So, do you have what it takes to rule the Battle Frontier?<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/640780/extras/Headlines_Loadout.png?t=1552749851\" ><br><br>An ever-exponentially-growing number of different loadouts will ensure not only that your gameplay feels right to you, and that you don’t always know what to expect from your enemies!<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Classes</h2>4 completely different roles can be played strategically to ensure victory upon even the toughest enemies. Be you a Shooter, Digger, Tank or Healer, your team will be relying upon you to be as awesome as we know you are! Each class also comes with their own skills and abilities and different damage types, creating even more possibilities!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skills</h2>There are 3 skill slots plus 1 special ability slot. You can put whichever combination of skills you want in them! Furthermore, higher slot numbers cause your shots to have more power and higher costs. Pick them wisely, use them effectively!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Equipment</h2>Changing your base stats can be a highly effective way to make your unique playstyle work best and ensure victory over your enemies. However, be aware that you can never increase any stat without decreasing another in return. This balanced system ensures NO PAY-TO-WIN will ever be possible! Since no player can be directly stronger than another, may the best team win!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Consumables</h2>6 slots, endless possibilities. In need of healing, some extra damage, or even greater mobility? Consumable Items are what you’re looking for! Picking the right combination to fit the situations you are expecting will make the game a lot more fun and rewarding. Not only that, some items will even have different versions with higher effect at the cost of more slots! There’s no telling how powerful you’re going to be on the battlefield! <br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cosmetic Skins</h2>Change the way you look every time you feel like it, simply by selecting a new and awesome skin! Even those expensive skins you don’t want to spend money on can be obtained in-game through events, drop boxes or even player-to-player trading!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/640780/extras/Headlines_Physics.png?t=1552749851\" ><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fully-Destructible</h2>The environment responds to the laws of physics like no other game of this kind. If you break the ground and a piece is disconnected, it will fall, along with any players standing on top of it. Furthermore, Fall Damage will be applied not only to falling players but also to players who were hit by falling objects!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interactive</h2>Every single one of our maps interacts with the player and/or environment in unique and interesting ways. Be it a clock on the background that you have stopped by breaking one of its gears, or a windshield that will now make the game way harder for your enemies, using the map is not only fun but also highly strategic!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Satellites</h2>One of your team’s most valuable resources. Manipulating the wind, affecting gravity or even causing a blast on your opponent’s terrain can greatly shift the odds in your favor! Their availability is however very limited and also varies according to each map, preventing them from becoming “overpowered”.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/640780/extras/Headlines_CFeatures.png?t=1552749851\" ><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Anti-Cheat</h2>Our system was built from the ground-up to ensure minimal possibilities for cheating. Players are simply not allowed to issue commands that aren’t expected in our very strict protocol. We expect this to make any game-breaking kind of cheating not possible. And if that’s not enough, reporting a player during a match will flag it for recording and analysis (including network activity), ensuring we can protect the game from cheaters as fast and effectively as possible. And of course, VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) will also be active and giving you the extra layer of protection you’ve grown to trust.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community</h2>Friends and Guilds will be available at launch for you to either play with your old friends or find new ones! Every game is a lot more fun with nice people to play with!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Competitive Mode</h2>Ranked Matches will provide our more experienced players a way to prove themselves in a more strictly controlled environment, with even more focus on balancing and cheating prevention. Some bonuses will also be rewarded as your rank progresses, such as badges and some boosts.<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Matchmaking</h2>This will be implemented as an option on casual mode and mandatory on competitive games. For this game, we want more than wins, losses, and exp to count towards balancing players together, so we should also be tracking many other statistics of how everyone plays (such as accuracy, favorite loadouts, and so on) so we can match teams that have a better chance of working well together, and enemies that feel more like your level.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/640780/extras/Headlines_PFeatures.png?t=1552749851\" ><br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Steam Trading Cards</h2>The full package with backgrounds and emojis will be available at release for you and your friends to have more fun and rewards even outside of the game!<br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Steam Acvhievments</h2>Win ALL the things!
