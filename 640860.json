Scavenge for materials to craft strong or cunning weapons, perfect for securing your next meal or to raid your enemies with.  Travel north into the mountains to collect rare obsidian and create a spear powerful enough to take down a mighty mammoth.  However, be sure to create warm enough clothes and homes to survive the cold winters, else you'll be forced to migrate back south before you freeze.

Leaves and grasses die of frost, and with their destruction comes the starved demise of fauna, and with them follows the dwindling of the native tribes. Anger, food, stone and fire are all they had left to cling to, and with their weapons, tools and bitter desperation, they set towards the rising sun in search of warmer lands. Such was the story for many thousands of tribes, and in their wandering migration there begun countless battles over people, shelter, food and territory. Large groups split to smaller clans over feuds amongst themselves, spreading far and wide to a warm and hostile terra incognita. Animals new to their eyes plague the nightmares of them and their children, and the scowling natives give them no peaceful welcome.
