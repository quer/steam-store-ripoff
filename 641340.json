Lance Ingram (Daniel Beaty) struggles to adapt to a changed Harlem. Lance lives under the tough supervision of a Parole Officer in a Half Way House. Unable to find a job with the computer tech training he received in Prison, Lance is forced to take a deliveryman job in a food pantry. It is then that he meets and is befriended by Ms. Maddy (Loretta Divine), a 60 year old strong and spirited grandmother. Lance assumes responsibility for Ty's (Khadim Diop) well being, Ms. Maddy's 15 year old grandson - a promising student and artist who has become involved in a dangerous Harlem Street Gang. Lance tries to make peace with G-Rod (Justin Martin), the charismatic Gang Leader and makes a deal to let Ty walk away. But when Gang Members decide to punish Ty for disobeying the &quot;law of the streets&quot;, Lance decides to sacrifice his &quot;second chance&quot; at freedom so that Ty can have a &quot;first chance&quot; at a better life.",
