Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Brace yourself for a real challenge as Victory Works bring Sir Vincent Raven’s powerful fleet of LNER Q6s to life on the Weardale &amp; Teesdale Network – the first public route to use steam locomotives! You’ll be taking control of a locomotive that was specially designed for freight-pulling power and testing yourself against every difficulty the Pro Range label can throw at you.<br><br>The operational characteristics of the LNER Q6 are complex and the simulation captures them as such. Advanced mode can be toggled depending on how you wish to experience the LNER Q6 – when enabled you can look forward to; realistic wheelslip, simulated steam chest, realistic train pipe and reservoir vacuum braking, cylinder cock management, boiler management with priming possible, realistic injector control and realistic “by the shovel” stoking with synchronised sound.<br><br>Being such a successful class the Q6s were rarely modified substantially, however they did have unique details such as steam heat dials, external vacuum brake pipes, piston caps, and overhead warning labels.
