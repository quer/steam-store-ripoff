It was the first of what would become a 3 part series created, funded and for the fans of Half-Life and an homage to the creators of the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Episode 2: Part One</h2><br>This episode picks up right after the first and follows the characters as they negotiate the Hydro electric sub station on their way to the Lambda complex. Headcrabs and the marines and there booby traps await them as they are pursued trough the sub station.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Episode 2: Part Two</h2><br>After getting up close and personal with some creatures from Zen, Gordon and Evan must square off against the HECU commander before they can make their way to the Lambda Complex. <br><br>This is the final part of the series.
