Built from 1926 to 1929 under the direction of Southern CME Richard Maunsell, these classical carriages were built to replace much of the wooden bodied pre-grouping stock Southern inherited from its constituents. The new carriages were based upon the former LSWR &quot;Ironclad&quot; carriage designs, and comprised First and Third Class compartments, each of which contained a corridor and doors for each compartment, enabling quick egress on commuter services.<br><br>The Southern usually ran their carriages in defined sets, though many individual carriages were classified as &quot;Loose&quot; and could be added to trains when required, this was the case with many BCK's and TK's. It was common practise to combine sets to make longer trains in busy periods.<br><br>The Maunsell's would be seen over all the Southern network on suitable tracks. On trains to the west of England it was common practice to place a number of BCK's at the end of a consist. These where dropped off at station with branches when the train stopped, and formed the branch trains, sometimes with a TK.
