As the dark king rises, civilizations crumble into chaos. To survive one must navigate the complex web of cities and pair with the denizens dwelling within: team up with the best, prioritize tasks, and weigh choices to guide the world towards the desired end.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meaningful Progression:</h2><br>While equipped with a main plot that spans over 20 hours and 60 thousand words, the game provides much more than simply level grinding in its progression. Herbs, alchemy, trading, and other methods all provide means to develop your characters. Dungeons and battles are distributed to enable variety in tactics and character customization. We want every battle and dungeon to be meaningful.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Open World:</h2><br>Time might be the essence in a failing world, yet the game never punishes the curious.
