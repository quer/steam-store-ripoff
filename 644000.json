Taking place 150 years in the future, mankind has finally acquired all the necessary technologies to contour space. The real question is, does humanity have what it takes to thrive in the unknown reaches of the solar system?<br><br> The main goal of the game is to reach Alpha Centauri, in search of a rumored, advanced human society who had supposedly created an Artificial Intelligence believed to be astronomically more advanced than modern scientists can comprehend. <br><br> Interstellar Prime will have a strong emphasis on sci-fi realism, the technologies you will see in the game are all based on real science and genuine projects that are being studied by scientists today. This means there will not be things like Teleportation, Mind Reading, or Warp Drives, for example.<br><br> The game will lead you to explore the real questions of conquering space,  does humanity have the ethics, responsibility, or capability to be a space-faring species? This game will take you on an action-packed journey in a scientifically driven story filled with mystery, discovery, and thought-provoking gameplay. <br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WW4rIKY.png\" ><br><br><br>Merging three massive game genre's is a challenge, but its that pressure that motivates us to deliver an immersive and revolutionary experience. An experience that will put you into the shoes of a 22nd century starship captain, and with such an exciting role comes many obstacles to overcome. As you pioneer the stars, you will learn that there is much more to being a captain than just exploration, you can lead a faction, forge alliances, wage war, build your own structures on planets, start your own mining company, found new and profitable trade routes, uncover a deep and eerie mystery of a long lost advanced human society, and much, much more. <br><br><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/n4erOAelAktxe/giphy.gif\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><br>Starship control: The bridge is where you command every aspect of your mission.
