Taking place 150 years in the future, mankind has finally acquired all the necessary technologies to contour space.

This means there will not be things like Teleportation, Mind Reading, or Warp Drives, for example.<br><br> The game will lead you to explore the real questions of conquering space,  does humanity have the ethics, responsibility, or capability to be a space-faring species?

As you pioneer the stars, you will learn that there is much more to being a captain than just exploration, you can lead a faction, forge alliances, wage war, build your own structures on planets, start your own mining company, found new and profitable trade routes, uncover a deep and eerie mystery of a long lost advanced human society, and much, much more. <br><br>Starship control: The bridge is where you command every aspect of your mission.
