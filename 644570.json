Now they donât give her money anymore, so Sakura has no choice but to find a part-time job. She has to work part-time to earn money and meanwhile goes to school. All of her classmates think that Sakura doesnât like talks, and they donât know what she is thinking about at ordinary times. In fact, there is always a dream in Sakuraâs heart, that is, to get out of poverty and become rich. She has been striving to realize her dream all the time.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nCV: Lianggui<br />\r\n <br />\r\nShe usually has worries in her mind, and doesnât speak often. Therefore, her classmates believe that she is unpredictable. As a born beauty, she is busty. She could have become a popular beauty in the school. However, she is not so popular, because she is not good at social contact. She only has some fans who admire her secretly. She is able to peacefully accept things unacceptable to ordinary people, which probably results from her fatherâs job, a war photographer. She often followed her father to many places when she was very young, and also encountered dangerous situations. Therefore, she has excellent physical fitness, which is enough for her when she deals with hooligans. She is somewhat insensitive, so itâs hard for her to understand how others feel. A neighbor, who is a childhood partner of her, often comes to her house to have dinner with her, but she has never perceived the boyâs admiration for her.",
