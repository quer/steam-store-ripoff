Players build, repair and upgrade barricades and turrets, craft weapons and try to survive waves of enemies.<br><br>Each game consists of a few waves of enemies and the players have time to build their defenses after they deal with each wave. The last wave is always lead by one of the enemy bosses, highly dangerous individuals that will test your defenses and skills to the fullest.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/nadpis01.png?t=1535355841\" ><br>First of all, we wanted to create a fun shooter game that has everything players expect and desire. Tons of different weapons, fluid animations and a good feeling from shooting bad guys. And because Band of Defenders is a cooperative game, you can play it solo, with friends or with complete strangers — it is completely up to you how you want to enjoy your game. The world of Band of Defenders is also extremely brutal, so make sure you can handle a little bit of bloodshed.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/BoD.gif.png?t=1535355841\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/nadpis02.png?t=1535355841\" ><br>Do you like survival games where you have to build defenses to survive attacks from savage enemies? We love those but we think that it takes too much time to play, for example, 7 Days to Die and really enjoy it. Band of Defenders comes with a similar idea but it's focused on shorter (around 20-30 minutes) individual battles. You start only with a basic equipment but you fortify your stand to beat more and more dangerous waves of enemies and beat the boss that comes at you in the end.<br>You build various barricades and automated turrets, craft weapons, set minefields to protect vulnerable spots and prepare for the worst, which always comes.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/BoD_gif_04.gif.png?t=1535355841\" ><br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/nadpis03.png?t=1535355841\" ><br>You get experience points after each battle and, by leveling up, you get a crate with some useful equipment – new guns to craft, new upgrades to your turrets, new barricades to build, perks that give you a better gun on a better start of each game, etc. So, a higher level means more and better equipment and a higher chance to survive, especially if you want to play on higher difficulties.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/BoD_gif_03.gif.png?t=1535355841\" ><br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/nadpis04.png?t=1535355841\" ><br>Are you ready for one of the best visual customization experiences you can have in online shooters? Without buying keys to actually get items you rightfully won? Band of Defenders lets you customize all characters without trying to rob you. You just have to win a game, get your new items and try to figure out what combination of visual items give you the best looks. From character skins, headwear and face accessories to cool armors and knife skins, ranging from regular items to crazy ones, you will have almost an infinite number of combinations so your character will be unique.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/BoD_gif_02.gif.png?t=1535355841\" ><br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644640/extras/nadpis05.png?t=1535355841\" ><br>You are a mercenary, member of the elite group Band of Defenders.
