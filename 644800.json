            "detailed_description": "SpacerX – Dome Survivals is a hard core multiplayer, survivor FPS that mainly focuses on survival and defeat mysterious creatures.  You have to start from the basics that are gathering food and building not just against other players, but against aggressive creatures as well.  Team up with your friends, defeat everything and be the most powerful player. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644800/extras/DescText_StayAlive.png?t=1503911139\" ><br><br>You have essential needs to survive, such as thirst, hunger and keeping the ideal body temperature. If you do not pay attention to only one of these, you will not make it long. You should always ensure a sufficient amount of food.  Furthermore, you have to pay a special attention to your clothing. If you wander for a long time, you’ll have to bear in mind that you need to pass through several domes, and you will be exposed to different weather conditions. You should always carry proper clothing with yourself. <br><br><strong>Collection of materials and construction</strong><br><br>The house puts pressure on its fundaments, if some of the supporting pillars of the house are destroyed, the whole construction falls apart that is why enhancing buildings is very important. All structures and objects can be painted to personalize your home. The shelter provides protection against the weather conditions for you and your values. By cutting down the trees from the wood and mining metal and other precious ores, you can make huge, multi-storey buildings by using complex, related parts, including ramps, columns, windows, doors, gates, remote control gates, trap doors, generators, wires, all kind of electrical tools, ladders and many other types of batteries. However, you have to be aware that the required materials cannot be found everywhere. Sometimes you need to go to dangerous places for more valuable materials.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/644800/extras/DescText_LiveAnd....png?t=1503911139\" ><br><br>You can find many different creatures and plants in the SpacerX domes. Plants should be watched and studied, some of them can be planted as well, thus providing nourishing and light food. Meanwhile, other plants can produce useful medicine and lethal toxins that you can use for your own goal. You had better be careful with the wildlife as well. Normally, during the day, you will encounter with tamed animals that are easy to hunt down and you can obtain a huge amount of meat and other materials. Nevertheless, the predators of the island emerge at night as well. Depending on their species they may cause minor difficulties or certain death. And do not forget that different kinds of animals dominate in each climate, so do not get overconfident! Be always very careful and prudent. <br><br><strong>Development and learning</strong><br><br>You will be able to develop and learn in SpacerX at the same time. Your learning is optimal if you fight, discover and experiment as much as you can. Then you can learn things that help you to build, construct and fight more efficiently, and survive. This allows you to build stronger walls, shoot more accurately or hide in the wild landscape more efficiently. During your development, you are going to learn the method of producing different building blocks, weapons and other objects. You can achieve more advanced tools and building blocks.<br> <br><strong>The mysterious place</strong><br><br>Discover all areas because it’s worth it. Somewhere you can find valuable raw materials and rare tools. But be careful! The wildlife is extremely dangerous, and other players can also hinder your goals.

In the mysterious world of SpacerX, you can choose each path. If you are persistent enough, you will definitely be the champion and ruler of the domes.
