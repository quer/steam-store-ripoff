Plan your exploration well and be mindful of your choices. Resources and friends are scarce in Fabular's deep space, and they can make or break your adventure. The adventure part of the game is influenced by modern day rogue-likes such as FTL: Faster than Light and Hand of Fate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle</h2><br>Control your spacecraft directly from a top-down view, and use the skills and equipment of your spaceship tactically to overcome the enemy. The combat system is deep and challenging with large 'build' variety. The battle part is inspired by the Star Control series and Dark Souls.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage</h2><br>The outcome of battles depend largely on the condition and equipment of your ship. There is only so far your action skills can take you, if you are not equipped for the situation, you will likely perish. After each battle you get some form of loot (currency, resources or items) which can be used to upgrade your ship, trade at shops or enhance your battle gear. The management portion of the game draws inspiration from such classic Action-RPGs as Diablo and Path of Exile.",
