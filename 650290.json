He had a lot of names: Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas, Ded Moroz, Sinterklaas, etc. Each year he spent preparing for a Holday Season: Prepared presents for the good and obedient children all over the world. But he was not alone in this difficult task: He could always expect for assistance from his little helpers, the elves. When Christmas came, he harnessed the reindeer to the sleigh and traveled far and wide, as children all around the world were waiting for gifts.<br />\r\nBut everyone liked things this way. A wicked and greedy overlord, that acted as if he had never received any gifts, decided to spoil the Holidays for everyone. With help of artfull lies and deceit he stole the reindeer, so that Santa won't be able to distribute gifts to children.<br />\r\nSanta immediately ordered to equip a rescue mission.
