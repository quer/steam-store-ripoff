Each new game generates a new and fully dynamic world, and it is yours to develop: Dig and build anything, anywhere!<br><br>All machines have been carefully modelled down to small details. They all have opening doors and hatches, switches that control fully simulated systems, and have realistic physics models. You climb into and onto the machines, watch battery and fuel levels, follow realistic procedures that mimic the real machines. Our goal is to make you think of these machines as your own.<br><br>What you choose to do is up to you. Machine World revolves around Blueprints, which are generated by us at Trino and by players. Blueprints challenge you to build certain structures, and can have time and fuel limits. But if you just want to develop your own buildings in your own world, you can.
