All rules that apply to Location cards apply to the Crossroad cards. Crossroad card can be played as the first, second, or third card of a series of 3 cards of the same color, in order to get a Door card from the deck; the color of the two other Location cards of the series determines the color of the Door you can get. When drawing a Door card, regardless of its color, you can discard the Key Crossroad card to get the drawn Door card.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Dead End cards are Location cards, but have unique features; unlike other Location cards: They can never be played on the table.\\n\\n- They can never be discarded “one by one”: if you draw a Dead End card, you must keep it in your hand until the end of the game, unless you discard your whole hand at once (by resolving a Nightmare or by triggering an Escape – see the next section). When you draw a Nightmare card, if the penalty you choose is to reveal the top 5 cards of the deck, the Dead End cards are considered Dream cards: they are not discarded, but are put into the Limbo pile.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSame as in the basic game, with the following exception: In phase 1, you now have an additional option: trigger an Escape. Escape: discard your hand and draw a new hand of 5 cards. Note: this is the only way you can, by your own initiative, get rid of Dead End cards in your hand. Those cards go to the discard pile.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a more difficult game, play with the following rule: a Crossroad card can be only played as the second card of a series. Obviously it can still be discarded.",
