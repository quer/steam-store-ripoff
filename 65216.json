Originally dating back to 1842, the line runs through open countryside passing through several stations including Haymarket, Linlithgow, Polmont, Falkirk High and Bishopbriggs, and passes the famous Murrayfield Stadium outside Edinburgh and the world famous Falkirk Wheel. Also included is the Falkirk Grahamston Branch between Polmont and Greenhill Upper Junction and the Class 170 Turbostar DMU. The route features highly-detailed models of both terminus stations, all stations along the line and the expansive intermodal terminal and refinery area, complete with atmospheric sound effects. The Edinburgh-Glasgow Expansion Pack has been developed by Thomson Interactive with a focus on the ‘driver’s eye’ view, all station and line-side features being fully detailed and more distant landscape features represented with simpler detail to improve game rendering performance while driving.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Includes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tClass 170 DMU.<br></li><li>\tFull Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk High route, with Edinburgh Waverley, Haymarket, Edinburgh Park, Linlithgow, Polmont, Falkirk High, Falkirk Grahamston, Camelon, Grangemouth Intermodal Terminal, Croy, Lenzie, Bishopbriggs and Glasgow Queen Street.<br></li><li>\tSix scenarios plus four free-roams.</li></ul>",
