A major feature of the route is the Woodhead Tunnel system, comprising three tunnels (the third being added specifically for the electrification of the line) to enable the line to run through the hilly landscape of the northern Peak District. <br><br>The Class 76 electric locomotive was first produced as a prototype (6701) in 1941, with full production beginning in 1950 in Manchester. Under British Rail, Class 76s hauled freight and passenger services along the Woodhead Line until 1970, after which they handled only freight workings. Now closed to traffic since 1981, the Woodhead Line and its tunnels are still a regular destination for rail enthusiasts and hikers, and they have now been brought back to life in Train Simulator.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>60-mile Woodhead Line route from Manchester Piccadilly to Sheffield Victoria including Wath branch and Woodhead Tunnels<br></li><li>Class 76 electric locomotive<br></li><li>Class 08 diesel shunter in BR Black<br></li><li>8F Steam Locomotive<br></li><li>Mk1 coaches in crimson livery<br></li><li> Download size 842 MB</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Scenarios</h2>7 scenarios, including career and standard, plus 4 free roams<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>\tIn the Bleak Midwinter (Standard)<br></li><li>\tI`ve Never Known a Night Like It (Standard)<br></li><li>\tRun for Your Wath (Standard und Karriere)<br></li><li>\tThe Hadfield Flyer (Standard und Karriere)<br></li><li>\tThe North Country Continental (Standard und Karriere)<br></li><li>\tTo Lincoln Central (Standard und Karriere)<br></li><li>\tUp the Junction (Standard)<br></li><li>\tPlus 4 free roams </li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
