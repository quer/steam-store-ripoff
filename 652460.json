Units are built from the ground up using  voxel-like modules that determine their stats and abilities. Maps are 3D and volumetric, rather then mere height maps. Resources are continuously recycled into scrap piles. Features multiplayer, replays, and a simple single player campaign.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Custom Units</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/652460/extras/Time_Lapse_test.jpg?t=1525191002\" ><br>Design your units in the blueprint studio. Use modules to shape and define each unit, no preassigned roles or tech tree limits, everything is determined by you. Create builders, miners, buildings, warriors, whatever you need to make your ideal faction. Use 5 module levels to create different tech tiers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dynamic units</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/652460/extras/Dyn-steam.png?t=1525191002\" ><br>Modules don't just affect unit stats in the blueprint editor. Units gain and lose stats as their modules are built and destroyed. If a partially built unit has a completed repair module, it can help build itself. Disable enemy cruisers by destroying their thrusters. Disarm units by breaking their weapons. Even partially built units can be sent into combat if some movement and weapons modules are finished.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Terrain</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/652460/extras/Terrain-desc.png?t=1525191002\" ><br>A voxel based terrain engine allows for new features in RTS maps, multi-layer platforms, tunnels, alcoves, traditional top down maps, and side scrolling style maps. Maps can be procedurally generated or designed in a map editor. New map generators can be modded in and shared in the workshop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Design your units in the blueprint studio.
