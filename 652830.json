You vaguely remember falling, but you have no idea where you landed. “None have disturbed my slumber and escaped alive!” The ominous voice booms as you realize the entrance has been blocked and you are trapped in a tomb alongside an ancient Pharaoh; you need to escape! There must be a hidden passage somewhere, but instead of doors, you encounter a series of puzzles. Use the ancient artifacts to solve the Pharaoh’s riddles or face his wrath and be doomed to the darkness of the tomb for the rest of eternity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a short escape room experience, averaging about 20 minutes. This game was designed with a very low learning curve so both beginners and advanced players could easily understand the mechanics. We also aimed to minimize player fatigue and motion sickness by balancing quality and duration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLost Legends: The Pharaoh’s Tomb is a partnership between the talented developers at Escape VR and the innovative designers at Escape Games Canada. Together, this team has worked to create the ultimate VR escape room experience.
