One day, he receives a repair request from an university laboratory. He accepts the request and ends up meeting a girl named Koyori, who has been bedridden for a very long time. Guided by something unknown, Tazuna touches Koyori’s fingertip, and they create a weapon called “Nimrod”. After creating the Nimrod, Tazuna hears a voice:\r\n\r\n“Those of you who’ve overcome many battles and difficulties, who’ve had a revelation, and who intend to challenge Me are “Hand Shakers.””\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Tazuna and Koyori get pulled into a whole different world called “Ziggurat”. In this world, there are Hand Shakers, two people who touch hands and create the Nimrod. Their goal is to defeat other Hand Shakers in order to gain an audience with “God”, who will grant them wishes. Bewildered by this new world before him, Tazuna tries to comprehend what’s happening.
