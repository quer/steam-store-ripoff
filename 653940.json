The most obvious example is the location layout, but you can also easily check your survivors' skills, injuries and special modifiers.<br><br><strong>Are survivor relationships important?</strong><br>Absolutely. We've refined the system so you can have more ways to change relationships. In addition to the rumour system, we’ve added a new option: redemptions. <br><br>This involves one survivor being asked to do certain tasks to 'redeem' themselves in the eyes of another, which removes a prejudice. It's also more obvious what might happen to relationships during a dilemma, so you can tactically choose an option that improves relationships.<br><br><strong>Is combat still brutal?</strong><br>Combat is still the most dangerous aspect of the game, but you have more control over breaching.
