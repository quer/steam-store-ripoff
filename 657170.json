Do you like blowing up zombies to bits together with your friends? Protecting your base from the enemy team? Grab your gear and start the chaos!<br><br>Shoot 'm Up is a fast-paced tactical shooter with lots of different game modes. The game features a customizable server, offline gameplay, a campaign mode, LAN and multiplayer action, custom maps (with a map editor), smooth gameplay, stunning graphics and awesome effects. You can currently try the Deathmatch, capture the flag, or team-deathmatch mode - just shoot at each other or at bots using one of the 18 different weapons; or you can jump into co-op zombie survival mode so you and your friends can hold off as many zombies as you can!<br><br><strong>Regular updates</strong><br>I'm playing this game myself as well.
