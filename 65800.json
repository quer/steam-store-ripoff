You can choose if you want to play stealthy, turn invisible, and plant traps behind enemy lines with the Huntress or go all out, block off choke points, and brutally beat your foes into submission with the Squire!<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>Loot and Level-Up</strong> - Grab the mounds of money and items that your defeated foes drop and trade them or store them for later use in your Item Box!
