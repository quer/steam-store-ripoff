The more fruit your Buddy eats, the more points you will earn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut remember: Buddies only have a limited amount of time to forage, and they don't like sour fruits.

Be sure to dodge these obstacles!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUse your points to unlock and purchase eggs to hatch new Buddies, and customize your Buddies with cool markings and colorful wristbands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat are you waiting for? Come play!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplay:<br />\r\nFruit will fall from the trees overhead and it is your job to help the buddies catch them.<br />\r\nYou will control your favorite Lil' Buddy and run back and forth in an arcade style fashion trying to catch as much fruit as you can. <br />\r\nYou need to catch as much fruit as you can while avoiding dangerous obstacles like coconuts which will hurt your Lil' friends.<br />\r\nThe more fruit you catch, the more points you earn; which you can use to purchase cool things from the shop or unlock new levels on the island.",
