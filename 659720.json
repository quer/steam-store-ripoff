No longer a city, but a battleground littered with danger, she must give her all to take it back. Awaiting you are secrets of the past, the city's true colors and dark truths.

With her forces and allies acquired along the path, they take up arms against the Syr. She delved into the heart to see it destroyed, as well as any &amp; all Syr controlled by it. Upon arriving, some soldiers went missing. With what little men she had left, she pressed forward, only to be ambushed by and separated from her soldiers. What is to come of her unit? Could any of them have survived in this technological deathtrap?
