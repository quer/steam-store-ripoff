Truly, some places were influenced by the music, and vice versa. <br><br>-Pay very attention to the story, which is very intriguing and fascinating, mixing various components. <br><br>-The battle system is the old classical like Dragon Quest. Mixing components like Special Attacks and Magic. Adding a bit of pepper to make the events more incendiary. Basically, in the side quests, that depending on how you play, can become very difficult.<br><br>-There are many secrets, and it is not about the story (but that too!).
