Seriously, who’s idea was that? But yanno, me and my core team of way-too-good-for-me devs have kept at this for so many years cause we deeply believe in it. We believe this game deserves to exist, its story deserves to be told, its world deserves to be explored, and we have worked tirelessly in service of that. From day one what we’ve wanted was to make something you come back to a decade from now and think about. We hope that you get to know Aine and her world, and we hope through figuring this game out, you’ll feel that you yourself are a part of this too. For as long as I’ve lived I’ve dreamed of making a world that people would want to explore filled with characters that they’d get to know and feel for. Through its loooong development, however, I’ve discovered a game is greater than its parts. Lemme tell you - it took us two Kickstarters to make this happen. We got our butt kicked hard repeatedly. But what brought us back up every time was the community, our humble Discord, our backers, our fan artists and speedrunners. This game is not just about Aine’s journey, it’s not just about yours either, what this game is about is the journey we all take together. That special connection people have when they join together to do the impossible, to slay that dragon, that’s what this game’s about. It took a gajillion hours of effort from way more people than just the core dev team to make this happen, and hopefully it shows. I hope Renaine is gonna be that kind of game that lasts, a true modern classic, and we’d be honored if you’d join us to its finish!<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/662340/extras/Message_from_the_Pubs.gif?t=1553778191\" ><br><br>Hey, hey! Dan from DANGEN Entertainment here. Renaine is a unique take on platforming which is so incredibly refreshing considering how many talented developers have tackled the genre throughout its long history. It has this perfect balance of fun gameplay, funky characters and intriguing lore--it starts off fun and as you dig in you discover depth with treasures you never expected. I won’t say too much!
