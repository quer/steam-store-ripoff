CruisinMix features both the console original and the exclusive Arcade Mode + in a retro game fan's dream combination.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>The self-proclaimed “Super Duper Genius Smart Guy” Yamada has a plan to take over the gaming world; the obvious first step being to take control of all the arcade cabinets at the “You&amp;Me Kamiyoga” arcade in Kamiyoga, Tokyo! But part-time arcade employee Yui Ito is ready to take him on! Determined to put an end to this cunning plot before the arcade opens, she hastily hacks together all the used arcade circuit boards she has lying around and calls upon all the main characters to take down this evil genius!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Choose from 6 ships, each with their own unique weapon system and bomb and take the fight to the deranged Genius Yamada and his game-world spawned minions in multiple action and laughter-packed stages. With a cast coming straight from Jaleco's back-catalog and stages based around themes such as JRPGs, Japanese arcades and crane games there's never a dull moment.
