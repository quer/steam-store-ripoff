And boy does it work.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://vrscout.com/news/manifest-99-vr-experience/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VR Scout</a><br><br>“The story has a much deeper meaning than just a few travellers hitching a train ride – which VRFocus isn’t going to spoil here – safe to say that’s it pulls on the heart strings as a memorable VR experience.
