Survival isn't just about collecting food and a shotgun anymore. The swarms of zombies keep growing which forces you to work together in a desperate attempt to build something worth defending. Using the radio as a guide, you can foray into the city to hunt down powerful enemies, rescue lost survivors and engage in whatever mission you feel is worth the effort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShould you succeed in building a safe haven for numerous survivors your journey will not end there. The zombie forces will grow stronger every hour that you evade them and before long the more powerful mutants will become a serious threat to your colony's existence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery choice could be the difference between life and death for your group.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou discover this journal while scavenging an apartment building:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n--------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY 1: The Voice on the Radio<br />\r\n--------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI didn't have much when I set out to find other survivors, but it turned out to be enough. While sneaking from house to house, I came across a small group of zombies that were huddled around the noise of a crackling radio. My eyes widened at the sight, as a functioning radio might give me the opportunity to find other survivors. I loaded m gun, said a quick prayer and then moved into the street with my gun leveled at the nearest zombie's head. It took the rest of my ammo, but I managed to kill every zombie in a matter of seconds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe radio came to life when I picked up the receiver. &quot;Oh thank god,&quot; said the voice, as the man on radio gave me a recap of what had happened to his friends on this side of the connection. He told me that this might be a good place to set up for a base and that he'd help me gather up other survivors. He didn't give me his name and I didn't ask for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the radio man's help, I managed to sneak throughout the city and meet up with other groups who needed my assistance. They didn't want to join my base just yet, but I think I started to win a few over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY 2: Walls First, Storage Second<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNight time scavenging was pretty dangerous but worth it; I picked up a sweet katana and a sturdy riot helmet, among other useful things. It's funny, with all the gaming consoles out there that use batteries for their controllers, I have an almost limitless supply of flashlight batteries. I don't even bother picking them up anymore!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSleep was well earned once I returned from my night of scavenging but as soon as I could get out of bed I did so with earnest. It was noon and I had a call on the radio to go help defend a stranded survivor. Without hesitation, and secretly hoping that this person would join my group, I grabbed my gear and headed out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlexandra was her name and wow could she swing a bat! I figured softball had to have been where she learned because I have never seen zombie heads flung so effortlessly before. We fought off the zombies surrounding the house he was squatting in and once things quieted down I asked her to join my base. Didn't take much convincing as she appeared to be doing pretty poorly on her own and with that I had my first teammate!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the way back to the base we picked up enough materials to build up the walls and add on to the storage shed. Alexandra even volunteered to do the next scavenging run so that I could take a break.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY 7: A Lot of Luck<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere hasn't been much time to write. Between the arrival of the zombie dogs and birds recently and the lack of food, things have been dicey. Nobody has died, but I am starting to feel like there have been too many close calls lately. Alexandra was trapped by zombies when a zombie bird called out her location. If a random stranger hadn't joined her at the last moment she would have died. I had my own close call when my katana broke, but some quick thinking to use a stimulant gave me the adrenaline necessary to outrun my problems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo more people have joined us and the medical facility has finally been completed. We started pumping out medical kits but bandages aren't going to feed us. I will get on the radio and lead a group on a food scavenging mission tonight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY 8: Steve<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's my fault he died. I think he said his name was Steve but I'm having trouble remembering. I was leading a group of three other random survivors that responded to my radio call to hunt for food. Things were going well, until the biggest zombie I've ever seen smashed his way into the house we were looting. Steve, or whoever he was, never had a chance. The thing ripped his arms off like they were an ant's antennae. It took all three of us to bring it down. I should have been watching outside instead of being so concerned about making sure I got a fair share of the food being scavenged. RIP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY 9: Working Hard<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe got enough food to last a few weeks. Finally. I gotta sleep.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY 10: DAMN IT!<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlexandra died. Her bat broke on a zombie and three of its friends took her down. I should have been there. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY 14: Why write a title anymore<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's no more ammo. The others are all dead. It's just me again. If not for the man on the radio letting me know that there are people out there who need my help, I don't think I would keep going.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY 15:<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDamn it. I'm bit. This hurts like hell. I managed to stop the bleeding but I definitely am getting a fever. The infection can be beat and I have enough medical kits from when we stockpiled them. I think I'll be ok.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-------------------------------------------<br />\r\nDAY <br />\r\n------<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe last page is torn.",
