After Prince Pico and the city-state of Volturno leave the anti-magic Tetrarchy to explore the alluring possibilities of the magic sciences, the other states band together to retake Volturno and stop whatever scheme Pico may have begun with his newly-acquired arcane knowledge...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>You play as convicted prisoners, drafted into the Tetrarch’s army to undertake missions against Prince Pico’s forces and collect intelligence concerning his masterplan. While each prisoner has their own individual personality and backstory, all share one goal: to complete their assigned objectives and earn their freedom.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customization</h2>When you create your character you will choose from a variety of weapons and distribute your skill points amongst four stats.

A character with lots of health will allow you more room for mistakes while a character with little health will have to be more careful to avoid damage.<br><br></li><li><strong>Stamina</strong><br>    Stamina is used for each action in the game: attacking, defending and dodging. A character with lots of stamina will be able to chain together many attacks while a character with little stamina will have to be more tactical and patient.<br><br></li><li><strong>Focus</strong><br>    Focus prevents your character from being staggered by enemy attacks. A character with lots of focus will be able to shrug off damage while swinging away at enemies while a character with little focus should try to fight enemies one at a time.<br><br></li><li><strong>Movement</strong><br>    Movement determines the speed at which your character moves. A character with a lot of movement will be able to dance around their foes while a character with little movement will have to time their aggression carefully.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/666630/extras/20180907142828_1.jpg?t=1547563793\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Playstyle</h2>All the numbers in The Captives are very low so that the difference between spending a single stat point in health over movement can change the feel of how your character plays significantly.<br><br><br>It’s not possible to create a character that is good at everything.
