Skirmish Line aims to deliver an updated playing experience, featuring new mechanics and content. Both fans of Mud and Blood and new players alike will find the game challenging as they face off against the fanatical Imperial Japanese army, featuring a host of exotic weapons, vehicles, and of course, the infamous Banzai charges.<br><br>Skirmish Line is a brutal and difficult endless defense game featuring three modes: <br><br><strong>Defense in Depth</strong><br>Defend three positions in succession against the relentless Imperial Japanese Army. If the enemy overruns, you will retreat to the next position. Should you find the enemy assaults too overwhelming, you may manually fallback to the next position.
