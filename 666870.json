Of course, before you implement the plan, you should make a careful planning, grasp the action time of each character.<br><br>In the process of solving the case, the police will investigate the suspects one by one according to the suspects. And the police will ask for the alibi, and investigate the permanent location of the suspects. Every investigation will affect your suspicion. For example, if you don't have an alibi, the suspicion will increase. The police will finally arrest the suspect with the highest suspicion. If the player is handled properly during the action, the police will come up with a wrong conclusion. So the real murderer will escape. The Perfect Crime will be achieved.<br><br>To subtly increase the suspicion of other suspects, you can throw someone else's key at the scene.

However, these props cannot be used at any will. If you and the murder target in the same room, he will notice your action. Maybe your action will be stopped by him.<br><br>Players make some decisions, such as strangling or tying people up, which can increase psychological stress. If the psychological pressure is high, you will be limited from some action. Therefore, the reasonable distribution of psychological pressure will also challenge the player's strategic skills.<br><br>In the game, you will come into contact with many people, who have different personalities. Different people will react differently to the same thing. Timid people will immediately call the police when they see a dead body in the room.

It is often used in interrogations of suspects by police and detectives. It refers to the evidence that the suspect is not on the scene when the crime is committed.<br><br>Without a doubt, if you have an alibi, the police will greatly reduce your suspicion. It is the key to your success.<br><br>The game uses the witness form to judge the alibi.

If the victim's time of death is 8:30 and the scene is the victim's home, then you have an alibi.<br><br>Because the player is playing the role of the killer in the case, so the player's alibi is forged.
