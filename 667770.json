Nano Shift will take you on a search through time for traces of who or what released the Nano Virus that wiped out 80% of the Earth’s population.

Your journey will take you more than half a century in the past, to when humans could still safely walk the surface. To see through the deception and solve the mystery behind Nano Shift you'll need sharp wits, a keen eye, and a little help from a few friends.<br><br>Gameplay is a puzzle mystery mixed with exploration elements.

Two more chapters are in the works and will be released as they are finished. The price of this game will increase as more chapters are added. We're in early access and still have some kinks to work out, but it's quite stable and offers approximately an hour, to hour and a half, of play time.<br><br><br><strong>Gameplay features include:</strong><br>- Rich and detailed environments.<br>- Puzzles and interactions built for tracked motion controllers.<br>- Teleporting not required.
