The game captures an advanced combination of movement techniques with intuitive controls. Items can be touched, used, or destroyed for an even more intense feeling during the game. There are a lot of weapon types and a lot of different opponents. Each opponent has its own AI behaviour and its own unique fighting skills. Experience the fascinating moonscape and explore a dilapidated moon base with a lot of secret hideouts, impregnable hordes of opponents, and a sinister Sci-Fi setting. <br><br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/668840/extras/DeadMoonStory.png?t=1550338346\" ><br>It is the year 2393: You are an archaeologist.
