            "detailed_description": "<h1>FREE HOLIDAY BUNDLE AVAILABLE NOW</h1><p>Download 3 Free Interactive Fun Holiday Songs to play with Jam Studio VR - Jungle Bells, Carol of Bells, and Silent Night!<br><br>MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!</p><br><h1>JAM STUDIO VR ANNOUNCES NEW EDUCATION &amp; HEALTH CARE CONTENT &amp; EDITION</h1><p>Jam Studio VR today launched new Music Education in app purchase content (DLC’s) that allows anyone – regardless of age or experience – to learn about music principles, genres, and instruments. The Music Appreciation Series DLC includes an interactive music appreciation song for a broad range of music genres, including rock, jazz, classical, country, Hip Hop, and DJ, allowing users to learn about each of these music styles. The Music Fundamentals Series DLC includes interactive music lessons on the basic principles of music, including Music Notes, Major Scales, Minor Scales, Chords, Melodies, a combo, and a game quiz. Each of these DLC’s is now available at a price of $9.99. Jam Studio VR today also launched a new Learning Station Math &amp; Alphabet Basics DLC and Fun DLC for younger children. These DLC’s are available at a price of $14.99 and $12.99 respectively.<br><br> For those that are more serious about the learning and therapy opportunities with interactive music, we are also launching a new App - Jam Studio VR Education &amp; Health Care Edition - that features an extensive variety of fun learning and therapeutic content for anyone, at any age or ability, including individuals undergoing various rehab programs and/or with a variety of special needs. This includes the provision of learning, physical, cognitive, sensory, communicative, life skill, and social/emotional therapeutic exercises, experiences, benefits, and guides to share with family, friends, and professionals. The following is a small sampling of the reaction to Jam Studio VR in these applications:<br><br>“At Bethany Ranch Home we work with a large population of people with Down Syndrome, and they love Jam Studio VR - they absolutely love it! There’s some that I didn’t think would really be involved, and those are the ones that love it the most. The first thing you see when they start playing is a big smile, and it’s amazing to see some of my non-verbal people open up and shine. It’s honestly like magic!” said GLORIA Quinn, Assistant Program Manager, Bethany Ranch Home.<br><br>“Jam Studio VR is a highly motivating, engaging activity for our students, especially those that have fine and gross motor challenges, spatial awareness challenges, significant sensory challenges, and impulsivity challenges. This VR App and the process of having them wait in line brings their vestibular and other senses into play in order to engage and has been outstanding. It’s a highly discreet way to address all of those deficits for them in a way that they’re working harder than they probably would just to have the opportunity to do that.”  Said Matt Drowne, Head of Gateway Academy.<br><br>“Share Your Blessings, Inc. is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to helping children and adults with special needs. We have been using Jam Studio VR with these individuals at schools, day care centers, and other facilities and I have personally seen Jam Studio VR works wonders with this population. They are engaged and focused when using Jam Studio VR, have fun doing things they never thought they could do, and also exercise their fine and gross motor skills, cognitive skills, and other therapeutic goals. The new Learning &amp; Therapy content, including the lesson plans, the therapy guides, and the different music appreciation, instrument, and fundamentals education series are all excellent - I highly recommend Jam Studio VR!” Tom Reidy, Director Share Your Blessings</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>JAM STUDIO VR</strong><br><br><strong>UNLEASH YOUR INNER MUSICIAN &amp; FEEL THE THRILL</strong><br><br>• Anyone, at any age, can create and perform music. <br>                 - No complicated learning curve or music making experience required.<br>                 - Play virtual instruments of all kinds.<br>                 - Play like a DJ - make beats &amp; loops.<br>                 - It's great family fun, from children to seniors!<br><br>• Includes  23 interactive songs across all music genres.<br><br>• Featuring songs by superstar artists Miley Cyrus, Jonas Brothers, and rap icon Flo Rida, Grammy-nominated guitarist Craig Chaquico, acclaimed jazz saxophonist Euge <br>   Groove, and  legendary Megadeth bassist David Ellefson.<br><br>• Record &amp; share your masterpieces with your friends and family.<br><br>• Many additional interactive music songs are available via in-app purchases, including a variety of  Disney, Artist &amp; Original content bundles.<br><br><strong>GREAT FAMILY FUN</strong><br><br>• Great inclusive family fun for kids, teens, young adults, parents, seniors, and people of all ages and abilities.<br><br>• A broad range of additional family oriented interactive songs are available for all interest and tastes via in-app purchase.<br><br><strong>INCLUDES EDUCATION &amp; HEALTH CARE BUNDLE</strong><br><br>• Provides a broad range of physical, cognitive, sensory, communicative, life skill, and<br>  social/emotional therapeutic exercises and experiences to share with family, friends, and<br>   professionals.<br><br>• Includes 3 music instrument games, one music appreciation game (Rock Genre), one music fundamentals game (Notes), 4 life skill &amp; learning games, 5 life skill &amp; learning tutorial songs, and 1 fun story book song. <br><br>• Includes a broad range of life, basic education and learning skill lesson plans and songs for<br>  young children as well as individuals of all ages with a wide range of disabilities and special<br>  needs.<br><br>• Includes a Learning &amp; Therapy Overview Guide, and a professional therapy protocol guide is <br>   available via in-app purchase.<br><br>• A broad range of additional interactive music and educational songs are available for all family members and taste via in-app  <br>   purchase.<br><br>​Benefits families with young children and teens as well as individuals with various disabilities and special needs, such as Down Syndrome, Autism, Muscular Dystrophy, Cerebral Palsy, Spinal Cord Injuries, Intellectual Impairment, Physical Impairment, and much more.<br><br><strong>JAM STUDIO VR</strong> is based on Beamz Interactive Virtual Music Advanced Triggering &amp; Synchronization Technology.",

The VR options are nicely considerate to play space and making the choices is just immensely fun and diverting. We've had amazing fun with this, super creative and it's really great pass-n-play with mates too. I'm off now to buy the Phineas and Ferb DLC for my 10 yr old. Keep up the great start devs!”<br />\r\nLegoknockingshop<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Creativity without screwing up! This is a unique take on a music game that lets you create music but guarantees that it harmonizes. There's a huge variety of instruments and musical genres, making it a lot of fun to mix and match, trying out different combinations. It's fun to play and I really enjoyed the environments and VR elements, like the instrument selections and floating notes.”<br />\r\nwfthornton<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Jam Studio is truly an outstanding game. And I definitely recommend it to anyone that has a love for music. I play multiple VR games on a daily basis, and I got the privilege to beta test this game and see it improve tremendously over time. There is nothing better than kicking back after a long day and making songs and beats to all the different varieties of music this game offers. The instruments are awesome and look great. I usually play mainly action games but there's something different about this game that gets you hooked and want to come back. To top it off they have a minigame that allows you to play while listening to the song/beat that you created. The developers really outdid themselves with all the different features this game brings to the table. As I said before if you have a passion for music then this game is a MUST HAVE. Great work overall by the developing team.”<br />\r\nAblaine19<br />\r\n",
