To win you must survive. To survive you must scout the surrounding territories, defeat the local militias, subjugate the land with castles, feed and maintain the people, forge diplomatic alliances, appease the church and unite the land under your iron fist.  If successful and the Pope gives you the blessing, then you will become the King of France. <br><br>There's more. Now you can watch 30 minutes of BBC documentary footage which shows you how and why castles were constructed, planned, besieged and attacked prior to the age of gunpowder. Using this knowledge, you can create your own original castle designs to play against your computer opponents. Or, you can choose from 10 historical castles for your own personal fortress.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Real-time battles in a turn-based strategy<br></li><li>The ability to design your own fortress<br></li><li>Interesting historical videos giving you some insight into castle building</li></ul>",
