With their less hectec pace and with Snappy's ability to spin for an unlimited amount of time, even turtle-like reflexes can get  Snappy to the goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you've honed your turteling skills you're ready to take on the two Marathon environments, and to replay the casual environments more agressively... risking your shell for higher scores and to unlock all the achievements Snappy Turtle Ultimate challenges you with. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe faster Snappy eats consecutive snacks, the higher the score multiplier becomes. This is not only the key to beating your old best scores, but also the key to unlocking the Mega Turtle modes, which are unique to each environment!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat are you waiting for?
