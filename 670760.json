By analyzing the board, capturing, exploding pieces, preserving some pieces from being blown up, melting pieces, elevating and de-elevating pieces, you will attempt to REACH the level maker's OBJECTIVE(S) presented when PLAY BEGAN.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause this is a complex game, but simple to learn IF you play the tutorials, trying to explain it without playing the 21 tutorial levels will confuse most people.  The 21 levels available in the DEMO, which also includes 4 full release levels, are educational and fun.  You will be PLAYING the game INSTANTLY while learning, not falling asleep reading nonstop instructions for 3 weeks before being able to almost play the game!  However, this game is a THINKER'S GAME, not for the impatient.  If you don't like puzzles, don't bother with this one!  We don't offer you cheese with your whine and it takes a while to get good!  If you find your knees touching the back of your head, maybe it's time to take a break!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood luck!",
