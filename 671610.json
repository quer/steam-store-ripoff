You can read about our development goals and project ambitions on the Steam Forums.<br><br><u>Game Modes</u><br><br>1. <strong>Team Deathmatch:</strong> Team-vs-team game mode. The goal of a team deathmatch game is to frag as many players of the opposing team as possible until the time or frag limit is reached.<br>2. <strong>Clan Arena:</strong> Team game mode where you aim to frag the entire other team before your team is completely eliminated. Clan Arena has no item pickups, you spawn with all weapons.<br>3. <strong>Free for All:</strong> The goal of a FFA game is to frag as many other players as possible until the time or frag limit is reached. Unlike in Deathmatch, you spawn with weapons and ammunition.<br>4. <strong>Headhunt:</strong> Game mode where one player is tagged and all other players attempt to frag the tagged player. Tagged player gets score for each second he/she stays alive. The person who frags the tagged player, becomes tagged.<br>5. <strong>Duel Arena:</strong> Frag the most opponents in 1-on-1 combats. Your arsenal is fully replenished before each round. The winner of the round is challenged by the next player in the queue.<br>6. <strong>Deathmatch:</strong> The goal of a Deathmatch game is to frag as many other players as possible until the time or frag limit is reached.<br>7. <strong>Duel:</strong> Duel is a 1vs1 game mode. The standard match lasts 10 minutes, if there's a draw there will be added 120 seconds overtime. The player who frags their opponent the most wins the map.<br>8. <strong>Race:</strong> Players try to complete a course to achieve the fastest time possible through highly technical maps by means of bunny hopping, strafe jumping, circle jumps, air control, weapon combos, and tricks.<br>9. <strong>Bomb and Defuse:</strong> There are two teams that must defend or attack a bombsite. To win a round, a team can win by fragging all of the opposition, defusing the bomb, or ensuring it explodes.<br>10. <strong>Capture the Flag:</strong> There are two teams that must defend or capture their opponents flag within the set time limit.<br>11. <strong>Capture the Flag: Tactics</strong> Class based version of Capture the Flag, similar to Team Fortress.
