Players explore top-down levels full of monsters, hazards, secrets, and treasures. Battles are kept simple with an ebb and flow resembling the traditional style of Dragon Quest.

Some levels, treasures, riddles, and monsters are shuffled in each playthrough. This adds variety while retaining the experience of learning the game and maps.<br><br>In Casual Mode, the score system is disabled, and the player gains the ability to save freely, including an autosave feature. This mode lets the player enjoy the game at their own pace, and practice to score higher in Competitive Mode.<br>Competitive Mode is the more difficult primary game mode, with each monster, puzzle, treasure, and secret awarding points. With hundreds of scenarios, secrets, and bonuses, players have a virtually endless challenge awaiting them to get the highest score.

This is the perfect mode to play when you want to get in a quick game but you're short on time! <br>Also features Endless Dungeon +, which when playing on Competitive Mode, allows you to enter an endless dungeon after completing the main game, giving endless challenges and opportunities to blast your scores into the stratosphere.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/672920/extras/features.png?t=1529605607\" ><br><br>*A truly unique score based, fast paced competitive RPG.<br>*Gameplay heavy/Story light.
