We were so excited when he agreed to make a track for the All Walls Must Fall soundtrack, and we’re really hope we can put the track in-game.

He also performs electronic music live, and teaches music production on his twitch show, Music Workbench. He loves tacos and won't shut up about Deadly Premonition. He says he's excited to contribute to All Walls Must Fall &quot;because I love the uniquely focused setting.

In 2016 Kuedo released his follow-up ‘Slow Knife’ delving further into emotional filmscapes and anxious atmospheres. All Walls Must Fall marks Kuedo's first foray into procedural videogame music compositions, and we at inbetweengames are really happy to have him on the soundtrack.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Orion Correlation and Lost &amp; Found</h2>Ali Amel is an Iranian born electronic music producer who performs under the name Lost &amp; Found.
