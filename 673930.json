As a fully playable sim, it's also your responsibility to put the right person over in the right way at the right time for maximum impact! But with a locker room full of egos and rival promotions fighting to beat you in the ratings, your dream job could turn into a nightmare at any moment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFully unlocked as standard, this special desktop release also allows you to save your changes to all other 350 characters across 9 different rosters. If you want all the fun with none of the pressure, you can even enjoy acting out your own dream matches in &quot;Exhibitions&quot; of your own creation. Upon connecting one or more controllers, you can go beyond the game's mobile roots to enjoy console-quality gaming and multiplayer action!",
