It was equally at home on the road or track – perhaps the last dual-purpose road/race car produced – and has achieved legendary status amongst aficionados of the marque. With only a relatively small production run of thirty-six cars, and with many of the examples produced having a great racing pedigree, it has become one of the icons of Ferrari's production history, with a revered position in collectors' circles.<br><br><br><strong>Ferrari 312/67</strong><br>Scuderia Ferrari started the 1967 Championship with the 312/67.
