All three Simple Scenarios for the Kith'takharos setting --KS10, KS11, and KS12-- have been gathered into one bundle. <br><br>Each Savage Worlds Simple Scenario contains a Fantasy Grounds module and an accompanying 2 page PDF for an estimated 4-8 hours of playing time. The module contains all the information necessary to run the adventure. The PDF duplicates the contents of the module in an easy to read format. <br><br>KS10: Spider Hunt! <br>A foraging party stumbles onto a new species of spider and ignites a hunt for the creature's fiery web. <br><br>Two Order of the Jade Leaf scouts retreat from newly discovered Harlass Orn ruins when confronted by large red spiders. One of the scouts strikes a spark when his sword scrapes a wall, which ignites a portion of the spider webs in a large fireball. The characters are sent by the Order of the Jade Leaf to retrieve samples of flammable spider web. <br><br>Spider Hunt! is a Simple Scenario designed for 3-5 Seasoned characters. <br>KS11: The Repository <br>A mysterious cavern holds constructs inert since the end of an ancient war. <br>A thousand years ago, the Harlass Orn thrived in the swamps surrounding Kith'takharos. At the height of their achievements, the Harlass Orn fought a desperate war against extra-dimensional creatures called Veilwalkers. The Veilwalkers created numerous battle constructs and placed them in storage facilities called repositories. The characters encounter a Veilwalker repository that houses a cache of deactivated constructs. <br><br>The Repository is a Simple Scenario for 3-5 Veteran characters. <br>KS12: The Hideout <br>A fragment of an ancient bridge offers a commanding view of the surrounding swamp--and a defensible refuge for poachers. <br><br>Outlaws called poachers roam the swamps and nearby river lands. Poachers continuously spar with the Order of the Jade Leaf, waylaying shipments of swamp plant products, dodging and fleeing patrols. They turn remote islands or forgotten ruins into bases. The characters stumble upon a poacher hideout at the ruins of a Harlass Orn bridge. <br><br>The Hideout is a Simple Scenario for 3-5 Novice to Seasoned characters.<br><br>Released on July 08, 2011. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 2.9.9 and higher.<br><br><strong>Requires:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and a one time purchase of the Savage Worlds ruleset.",
