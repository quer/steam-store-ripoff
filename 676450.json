Don't worry, there are as many continues as you need. The goal is to concentrate and quickly memorize card locations. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter beating a Limited Attempts stage, you'll move onto Timed Attempts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a Timed Attempts stage, not only are you challenged with a maximum of two incorrect matches, but you also have only 25 seconds to complete all matches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first few stages will be easy, but as more cards are introduced into the mix, Double Memory becomes a real challenge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're invited to push your memory to its limits in...Double Memory.",
