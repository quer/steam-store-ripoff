There's always a fun upgrade to look forward to, and the numbers keep getting bigger! <br><br>Collect gold, upgrade your weapons &amp; teammates, and even join up with other players in the world as you defeat the enemies &amp; get stronger. <br><br>All of your favorite things from Time Clickers; Time Cubes, Active Abilities, Maximum Damage &amp; Research (aka Artifacts) are back and better than ever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MULTIPLAYER, CO-OP or SINGLE PLAYER</h2>   <br>Play in a Private, Co-Op (friends can join) or Public World. In Co-Op &amp; Public Worlds, player's Hoverbikes can merge together creating convoy snakes that move through the world as a pack. Get stronger and become the carrier of a group, or be backup support as you idle. You have the choice; go further together or faster alone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GUN CUSTOMIZATION</h2>Collect Perks and customize your Click Weapons, Drone &amp; Turret. Rain projectiles on a group of enemies with the Cluster Perk, create a Boss destroying build focused on Critical Damage, or combine a variety of perks to optimize your run.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">OPTIONAL PERMADEATH</h2>You choose how difficult you want your run to be - the higher the difficulty the higher the rewards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PER RUN LOOT</h2>The more you collect the bigger the bonus. Play it safe and evenly spread out your bonuses, or take risks for more powerful combinations. Your choices make each run a unique experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IDLE &amp; AUTOMATION </h2>Hop into your Hoverbike and automatically drive through the world as your Automatic Fire ability shoots auto-targeted enemies, letting you progress through the world even when you're away from your computer. Of course just like any incremental, the more you play the more you can automate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ACTIVE PLAY</h2>Take the controls and progress through the world faster. Find the optimal spots to quickly defeat enemies and swiftly move through the world using jump dash and bunnyhop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENDLESS PROGRESSION</h2>Upgrade Perks from Common to Legendary. Invest Time Cubes into Research making you stronger with each run as you explore thousands of zones spread across multiple unique planets.
