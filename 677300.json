Enter Chelo Martínez, a brand new private eye determined to find the people who slip through the cracks. Help Chelo navigate the beaches and back alleys of Miami at the height of the cocaine epidemic, and investigate five original cases, including the disappearance of her own father, ten years ago. You pick where to investigate, how to handle a suspicious witness, and who to call for backup. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlong the way, you'll meet an incredible cast of characters who can help Chelo or throw her off-track. There's even a little romance, but pursing that cute EMT at the hospital or your childhood best friend could chip away at the limited time you have to solve each case. Chelo grows and changes based on your choices; whether she becomes an ace detective is up to you! But be prepared for danger, tragedy, and distractions to block her way... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing an amazing original soundtrack, lush illustrations, and seven possible endings, Ghosts of Miami will pull you into 1986, and you'll never want to leave.",
