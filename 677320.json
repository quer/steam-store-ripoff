Each body writhes in pain, but you know with the unerring assurance of the dream that all are sleeping. A wavering voice swirls throughout the room, rising and falling in intensity, finally resolving into words: &quot;When will the dreamers awaken?&quot;<br><br>More than a thousand years ago, the reptilian race of Harlass Orn inhabited the swamps surrounding Kith'takharos. Their greatest architectural triumph was the construction of nine Teleportation Towers. These towers also precipitated the Harlass Orn downfall, for the magic employed in large-scale teleportation allowed malicious extra-dimensional creatures called Veilwalkers to enter normal space.<br><br>The Harlass Orn sought shelter in a magically protected refuge called Tarass Shar Orn. Here they planned to hibernate until the Veilwalkers left normal space. But the Veilwalker named Dreamseeker infiltrated Tarass Shar Orn and transformed the dreams of the sleeping Harlass Orn into perpetual nightmares. Now the Dreamseeker slowly consumes their minds.</i><br><br>The Dreamers Awaken is a Savage Worlds adventure for 4-6 Veteran characters. The characters must enter Tarass Shar Orn to free the sleeping Harlass Orn, battling the Dreamseeker's constructs before confronting the Veilwalker in its place of power: the Dream Realm, where the laws of physics do not apply and thought becomes reality. <br><br>This product contains a Fantasy Grounds module and an accompanying 64 page PDF for an estimated 25 hours of playing time. The module contains all the information necessary to run the adventure, including 14 custom tokens for NPCs and creatures.
