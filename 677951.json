The single-track line was doubled in 1907 to meet demands, however it has never been fully electrified – seeing only steam and diesel motive power throughout its life.<br><br>A fleet of DB BR 245 locomotives were brought in to modernise the route and are perfectly recreated for you to test your skills! These diesel-powered variants of Bombardier’s TRAXX family are capable of 160 km/h and are paired with double decker coaches to increase overall comfort and capacity throughout Allgäu.<br><br>Explore the southern portion of this historical 89 km route from Kempten to Lindau along with the equally scenic 20 km branch between Immenstadt and Oberstdorf.
