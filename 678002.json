Amtrak first turned to Electro-Motive’s E8 and its younger sister, the E9. Amtrak would operate nearly 200 E-units and the stylish EMD diesels became the workhorses of the early Amtrak era.<br><br>The E8 was produced by EMD from 1949 to 1954, and nearly 500 were built. The E8 derived 2,250-horsepower from a pair of EMD 567-series V-12 power plants, rode on an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement, and could be geared to operate at up to 117 miles per hour. During Amtrak service, the E8s operated throughout the country, handling both long-distance trains as well as short-haul services. Amtrak operated its last E-units into the early 1980s.<br><br>The Train Simulator Amtrak E8 is provided in cab and booster configurations and is available in Amtrak’s original red-nosed “Phase I” livery and stylish striped “Phase II” scheme. Single- and dual-headlight versions of the E8 are provided as are “as built” and rebuilt variations.<br><br>And there’s even more! Accompanying the E8 is Amtrak passenger equipment ideal to re-create U. S. passenger trains of the 1970s and early 1980s. Included with the E8 are an Amtrak baggage car, 48-seat coach, dome-coach, 10-6 sleeper, and diner in Amtrak’s Phase I passenger car livery.
