Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The captivating experiences of “Old West” American railroading awaits you with historic Union Pacific 4-4-0 No. 119 and its accompanying Train Simulator Cheyenne 1869 route as created by Smokebox!<br><br>It was Union Pacific 4-4-0 No. 119, together with Central Pacific’s “Jupiter,” that on May 10, 1869 stood pilot-to-pilot at Promontory, Utah for the ceremonial driving of the transcontinental railroad’s Golden Spike. Union Pacific No. 119 was one of five 4-4-0 “American” type locomotives built for the UP by the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works in November 1868. Following its historic moment at Promontory, UP No. 119 went on to serve the railroad until 1903. Like the “Jupiter,” however, Union Pacific No. 119 was reborn in the 1970s as a full-sized replica operating at the U. S. National Park Service’s Golden Spike National Historic Site.<br><br>Smokebox has once again created the extraordinary. Union Pacific No. 119 is re-created with a superb fidelity to every detail and features operating characteristics that are amazingly authentic. The UP 4-4-0 provides everything from the challenges of authentic wheel slip and managing the boiler and firebox conditions to the artistry of working with long and quilled toot whistles. Multiple settings for selecting difficulty and use of an auto fireman nonetheless make the 4-4-0 accessible and enjoyable for users of all experience levels. The locomotive is provided in two livery variations, including the prominently black and green livery believed by historians to be its original “as delivered” scheme, and the black and red colors that are applied to the modern replica.<br><br>To bring Union Pacific No. 119 – and challenging 19th century railroading – to life, the 4-4-0 is accompanied by a marvellous Train Simulator route representing the city of Cheyenne and its surroundings (extending about 6 miles to the east and 20 miles to the west) as existed in 1869. And joining UP 4-4-0 No. 119 on the Cheyenne 1869 route is a superb selection of period-authentic rolling stock, including a Union Pacific boxcar, flat cars (empty and with multiple loads), emigrant passenger coach with clerestory roof, baggage car, and combined caboose and coach. The route also offers a captivating selection of Old West structures and trackside assets, ranging from vintage engine servicing facilities to old west buildings and working ball signals!<br><br>One of the most realistic, unique – and captivating – railroading experiences ever to be enjoyed in a train simulation has come to Train Simulator – with Union Pacific 4-4-0 No. 119 and its accompanying Cheyenne 1869 route!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>Five captivating career scenarios for the Cheyenne 1869 route are included as well as a Cheyenne free roam scenario:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[UP119] 3:10 to Laramie<br></li><li>[UP119] Nineteen to Cheyenne<br></li><li>[UP119] West of Cheyenne<br></li><li>[UP119] In Old Cheyenne<br></li><li>[UP119] Rails Into Laramie<br></li><li>[UP119] Free roam scenario</li></ul><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
