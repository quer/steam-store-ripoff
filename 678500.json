In each one of the paths the player will run against the time and a timer will help him to improve his marks in each new attempt. They are short but challenging paths, and 2 camera modes are available providing different emotions. The controls are based on the keyboard and in each of the modes a control map assists the player in relation to the commands.<br />\r\nThe characters available for selection are Dylan and Isis, who have small differences in their performance. The average playing time are 10 minutes and the simplicity of the controls as well as the approach of the game make it suitable for a wide range of players.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nLevel 1: Rafting<br />\r\nAt this stage the challenge is to go down the river with a kayak diverting from natural obstacles like rocks and wild animals. There are floating bottles that represent the check point, and if collected allow the player to restart from a certain point. At the end of the course the character´s companion will be waiting for (him/her) camped on a small beach.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nLevel 2: Rapel<br />\r\nTo reach this level it is necessary to overcome the first challenge. This stage proposes the descent of a stone wall in the middle of a hostile climate. Here the check point is represented by a box tied to a balloon, sent by the character´s companion from the top of the stone. The player must reach the foot of the mountain where he will find his camp. On the way you should avoid scorpions, eagles, poisonous plants and sulfurous gases that exhale from the mountain.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nLevel 3: Tracking<br />\r\nThe last level is a dangerous desert trail that must be crossed with the bike. A bell hanging on a dry tree must be touched to activate the check point. Problems like avalanches, sandstorms, snakes and broken bridges will make it difficult to cross.<br />\r\nOnce you have overcome the 3 challenges you complete the game, and then you have the opportunity to improve your time continuously.",
