Avoid crashing into the land, though - that could cost you lots of HP - so try and maneuver carefully. Planets are not only orbiting the Sun as in real life, they are located in random positions to the solar system's main plane; making visuals more fascinating, and reducing distances at the same time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Physics</h2><br>Games alike are hard to find for a reason (a reason I know by now) is that simulations require plenty of resources, thus the physics engine must simplify. Fortunately, over time more powerful processors will become available.<br>Depending on their density and size every planet has its own gravity field. That means if you are standing upside down at the 'bottom' of a planet, you will not fall off; but the movements of the planets can be tracked noticeably.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">My First Game</h2><br>Before purchasing please note: it is my first game to be released.
