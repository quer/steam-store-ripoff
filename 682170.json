This house is home to the Witchkin--a family of terrifying toys, the children of a deranged woman known as the Candy Lady. Using her “children” she will do everything in her power to keep all who enter the house from ever leaving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe base play mechanics of Witchkin are primarily stealth. Sneaking, hiding, staying quiet and aware of the toys and your surroundings are skills required throughout the game. Witchkin boasts a very strong and unique art style reminiscent of early silent movies, painted in the eerie sepia tones of postmortem photos and the murky shadows of nightmares.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWitchkin is a one-man show, only one person created the game: art, music, voice (with a little help from family members), and programming.",
