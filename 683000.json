[…] If the development team can come good on the promise of a deep character evolution system and the promise of varied locomotion alternatives is realised, Evasion could well achieve its goal of becoming a landmark VR FPS title.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2017/10/preview-evasion-vr-cant-do-fps-tell-that-to-archiact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VR Focus</a><br><br>“It’s hard to really communicate why Evasion feels so much more intense than other similar games, but it’s noticeable very quickly.
