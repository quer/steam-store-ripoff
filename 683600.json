            "detailed_description": "<strong><i>Football Mogul®</i></strong> begins in any year you choose, from 1970 to present day with the full roster of your favorite team -- or an entirely fictional team of your own creation. <br><br>As General Manager (GM), your job is to build the best roster of players to take your team to the Superbowl. You can make complex player trades and sign players to multi-year contracts as you build your team, but you'll have to compete with the other General Managers, and negotiate with the player's agents. <br><br>As GM you also have to manage all the finances for your franchise, making sure that the team doesn't go bankrupt. Raise revenue for your team by setting the price of tickets and concessions, and selling the TV broadcast rights, while you manage your team's expenses by setting the budget for your player scouts, medical staff, and player payroll. But be careful, because fans can be fickle if your team doesn't win or if your tickets become too expensive! <br><br>If you don’t succeed in your first year, you get a new chance with Football Mogul’s in-depth rookie draft. You pick and choose from the best college talent around the world. If your new players are good enough,start them right away, otherwise send them to your bench for training and improvement. <br><br>Your involvement as GM does not stop in the team's front office. Football Mogul gives you complete control over your team on the field. You start by setting the starting defense, offense and special teams for your team. On game day, you choose your level of involvement. You can retire to the luxury box and make calls to the field as needed. Or you can take control of the play calling, choosing what plays to run, or passes to throw and when to blitz the opposing quarterback or play it safe in zone defense. A powerful game engine simulates each play of the game based on customized player ratings and over 45 years of historical data, assuring you the maximum realism possible! <br><br><strong><i>Football Mogul</i></strong> is designed to help you manage your team over many simulated years. Manage your team one day at a time, or let the computer simulate weeks or months at a stretch so you can play for virtual years or decades. As your players age, their abilities mature and decline realistically. Don't forget to build your team for the long term, rather than spending all your money on free agents this season. <br><br>Watch your team rise and fall in the standings, watch your bank statement, and read the news stories to stay on top of what's happening with all the ball clubs in both leagues. If you pick the right players, manage your finances well, and stick to a winning strategy, your team may win the Superbowl, and you too may become a <strong><i>Football Mogul</i></strong>!",
