These are the little touches that add subtle detail and enjoyment to the Truck Simulator series, the landmarks or at least hints of landmarks that are scattered throughout. I’m sure people with a greater familiarity with the area may find other little touches that just add an extra level of authenticity to the game.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.impulsegamer.com/american-truck-simulator-new-mexico-dlc-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Impulse Gamer</a><br><br>“SCS has done a great job at making the ATS’ world feel truly alive and realistic, and I hope that they will continue to do so as time goes on. New Mexico on its own has a lot of sights to see, alien-themes and all, so definitely consider picking it up.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://gamingenthusiast.net/2017/12/01/american-truck-simulator-new-mexico-dlc-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC Gaming Enthusiast</a><br><br>“Those 4000 miles of new in-game roads to be found in the New Mexico DLC still have variety, from desert to forests and mountains, not to mention the various urban environments such as Albuquerque.
