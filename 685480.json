And I for one would like to have my own time bathtub. The variety is great -- every encounter is different and interesting in its own right. No way for the PCs to get bored in this one!”<br />\r\nRay Vallese (Planescape, Numenara, The Strange)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“As the final part (3) in a series of epic proportions, the Lich Queen wrap up, which started with Tomb of the Lich Queen and continued with Machine of the Lich Queen, is set to be one of the greatest dungeons ever created and can go right along side anything from the newer generation of dungeons but can find itself compared even to some of the immortal TSR classics.”<br />\r\nGeekline415<br />\r\n",
