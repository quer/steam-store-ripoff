The first is a asymmetrical 4 versus 1, where survivors try to escape by searching for items to help them escape. The creature's main goal in this mode is to try and pick off the survivors. The second is a 15 player infection mode where an alpha creature must deceit the human players in order to spread its infection across the game mode. The survivors will be given guns to defend themselves from the infected.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is in first person to allow everyone to get a more realistic experience to create more scares; The horror genre will be much more prevalent.
