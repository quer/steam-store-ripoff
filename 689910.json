            "reviews": "“Another Lost Phone: Laura’s Story delivers on the uncomfortable, important, and personal journey it promises. Clever UI design, superb writing, and intricate, complex puzzling weave together to accurately simulate both a lost phone and the world of the real person it belonged to. Though it’s a brief, one-way ride, the takeaways (and music tracks!) will stay with you long after you’ve pocketed the device.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://apptrigger.com/2017/09/21/another-lost-phone-lauras-story-review-close-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >AppTrigger</a><br><br>“Another Lost Phone isn't a sequel. It's a game that builds on the legacy of its predecessor, using some of the same tricks, but presenting them in a much slicker, much more polished way.  The story is still at the core of things, and it's pushed along by clever logic puzzles that see you delving for scraps of information on the phone that you've discovered.  It deals with big issues, with dark themes, and with things that other games are too afraid to talk about. And for that alone you should pick it up and give it a go.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Another+Lost+Phone/review.asp?c=75359\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Pocket Gamer</a><br>",
