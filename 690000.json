There you were, one of the younger deities but still a god of great power nonetheless, minding your own business, doing godly stuff in the ancient halls of Throngur'dr high above the clouds. However, unbeknownst to you, the elder gods decided to entertain themselves by playing a prank on you and 3 other young deities and strip you of your godly powers for a &quot;fun&quot; day at the arena. Surely this doesn't sound like fun to you, but obviously it seemed like a really fun (and harmless, at least for them) prank to the elders. Now you are stuck without your powers for a day, reduced to mere slime that has to fight for its life force in the arenas chosen by the gods. All you know is that when this is over, you will be promoted to an elder god yourself, and after that... no one knows how vicious your revenge shall be. Until then... ready, set, BRAWL! <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/690000/extras/info_bar_readysetbrawl_small_v2.png?t=1511201936\" ><br>Slimebrawl is a 3D melee brawler game focused on quick action and fast rounds. Select your character, customize your appearance, choose your heirloom and get ready to brawl to appease the elder gods. Play together in 2-4 player matches and collect the most slime at the end of the game to win, ultimately bringing you the status of an elder god instead of a mere slime.<br><br>The basis of the game is that each character has a certain amount of slime which counts as that character's life points. When you get hit by an opponent, your health isn't lost forever, but is merely pushed away from your form - in turn this makes you smaller and lowers your strength with which you attack. Act quickly to regain your health by picking up the loose slime, or attack your opponents to steal their slime. Do not become too greedy without a clear plan though, as your size is proportional not only to your attack strength but to your character's speed. Being unable to quickly respond to the shift in terrain might spell disaster, as the levels change with the map getting smaller and smaller as pieces of the level collapse, bringing the fight closer to the middle of the field. Nobody likes a coward that runs away from a good brawl.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/690000/extras/info_bar_gamefeatures_small.png?t=1511201936\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/690000/extras/info_bar_.smallslimeface2.png?t=1511201936\" > <strong>Destructible maps</strong>  - The maps have been designed to fall apart as the match goes on, thus forcing players to fight bravely instead of running and hiding in the corners of the map.
