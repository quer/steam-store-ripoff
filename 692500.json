My keyboard was detected once connected to the computer too, I use a Roland PCR 500. Set up is as simple as that for anyone wondering. The AR is very on point here and I am no handyman at all and anyone can get this set up no problems what so ever.”<br><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/app/692500/discussions/0/1484356232250636030/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >TysonGT</a><br><br>“Coolest idea, like guitar hero but you actually get to play a real instrument.
