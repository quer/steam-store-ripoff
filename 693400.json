            "detailed_description": "<h1>Game Over View</h1><p>- A few highlights for the game\r\nThe survival map is the main portion of the game. Protect the statue in the center of the village from attackers. There is a total of 21 waves of enemy's. If you find that these are to easy let me know I can increase or change the wave patterns. You have 3 entrances to the village as the waves increase you could be getting attack from all 3 sides. Use your resources sparing-lee. They don't re spawn after you have acquired the resource. You will hear a battle horn that is your warning that you have 3 to 5 minutes before the enemy attack your village. You will hear one more battle horn as the enemy begin to spawn to attack your village. The time in between the attacks start around 5 minutes and increase slowly over time. You can attach your bow to your back by placing your hand to either side of your head and press the grab button on your motion controller. To retrieve your bow do the same but press the trigger button on your motion controller. Arrows can be drawn from your back on right in front of you. You also have a melee holster to attach one melee weapon. Gathering resources requires the pick ax. Get this from your village it is free. So don't go on a long voyage with out it or you wont be able to gather wood or stone.\r\n\r\nThanks again! leave a review!
