These are Rome, Gallic Rome, Palmyra, the Sassanids and the Gothi. Heroic factions have grander and more elaborate victory conditions, and unique named faction leaders who cannot die in battle.<br><br>Heroic factions also have their own flavourful and bespoke event-chains, representing the tales of these characters’ lives, which bring bonuses to their abilities and enable the player to make meaningful choices regarding their development and that of their faction.<br><br><strong>New events, dilemmas and missions</strong><br>Empire Divided brings a host of new events, dilemmas and missions, both general and faction-specific, to introduce new challenges, benefits and period flavour to your campaigns. <br><br><strong>Banditry</strong><br>This period of reduced governmental authority fosters the spread of Banditry. Each province now has a variable Banditry level which increases with the size of your domain and the presence of certain local buildings. Banditry can be reduced with the presence of armies, generals and special buildings. As Banditry grows, food levels fall, threatening faction-wide shortages. High provincial Banditry can also trigger special Bandit events to occur. <br><br><strong>Plagues</strong><br>Devastating diseases were commonplace in the 3rd century. When a plague hits a settlement it hampers growth, impacts public order and reduces income. Diseases can move between neighbouring territories, spreading with army movement and along trade routes. Sanitation buildings can prevent plagues from erupting and spreading, and key technologies can improve sanitation factionwide.<br><br><strong>Cults</strong><br>Alongside the more established religions, many cults sprang up in the 3rd century. These are represented by special building chains that can be constructed by any faction in any settlement. Three different cults are available in the game: Christianity, Mithraism and Manichaeism.<br><br>A cult building may be built for no cost, as its construction represents your empire permitting disciples to settle within your territory. This makes cult bonuses relatively easy to obtain, though cults spread foreign culture, bringing disorder into your provinces. In order to remove a cult building, a significant expenditure is required and a public order penalty is incurred required as this is considered persecution. Careful consideration of a cult’s benefits and disadvantages is required but, if used correctly, they can become a powerful tool.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>New General Skills</strong></h2>Generals’ skill have been overhauled, and now allow the player to customise and specialise their characters in the disciplines of Recruitment, Combat, Strategy, Governance and Maritime Proficiency.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>New Narrative Technologies</strong></h2> All technology trees have been restructured and redesigned to reflect the time-period and each of the game’s culture groups. Moreover, technologies in Empire Divided don’t represent scientific or technological breakthroughs; rather they represent the measures taken by rulers to deal with specific problems facing their empires. In this way, they help to tell the story of each faction’s journey through the period. This is especially true for the Heroic factions:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Aurelian’s technologies chart the journey of an emperor who must reform the military, then unify and defend his empire. <br></li><li>Zenobia’s technologies tell the story of her rise to power.<br></li><li>Tetricus’ technologies reveal his Republican political views in an age of fractured empire.<br></li><li>Hormizd’s technologies portray him as a ruler living up to the image of his predecessors, the great kings of the past.<br></li><li>Cannonades’ technologies tell a tale of Gothic bloodlust, and the many challenges his people must overcome in order to unify and persevere.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Updated building chains</strong></h2> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Rome features a new Administration building, which deals with tax collection, agent improvement and countering banditry<br></li><li>Naval Training buildings can now be constructed in the capital of a coastal province providing bonuses to ship recruitment <br></li><li>Palmyra gains a new religious building chain that is dedicated to the gods Baalshamin, Aglibol, Yarhibol, Malakbel and Nabu<br></li><li>Armenia gains a new religious building chain that is dedicated to Christianity<br></li><li>Several new unique buildings are available to selected factions. These are Rome (the Grand Temple of Sol Invictus), Palmyra (the Great Colonnade, the El Kanat irrigation system and the Grand Temple of Baal), Sassanids (the Grand Statue of Shapur I) and Armenia (the Etchmiadzin cathedral -  historically, the world’s first Christian cathedral)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>New Units</strong></h2><br>Alongside the existing unit rosters from ROME II, Empire Divided introduces a number of unique and signature units for every faction. Each faction features its own variant style and unique take on the classic Roman look and feel, with Aurelian’s Roman forces bearing the closest resemblance to the classic template. Unique Roman units are:<br><br><strong>Rome</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Legionaries<br></li><li>Heavy infantry units – Praetorians, Jovianii, Herulianii<br></li><li>Equites Dalmatarum – famous light cavalry<br></li><li>Clibanarii and Cataphractarii – very heavy cavalry, precursors to medieval knights</li></ul><br><strong>Gallic Rome</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Taifali Cavalry – famous associated barbarian cavalry (distinguishing shield designs)<br></li><li>Gallic Legionaries – distinctive from Roman Legionaries<br></li><li>Gallic Axemen and Longswords</li></ul><br><strong>Palmyrene Rome</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Palmyrene Legionaries – distinctive armour and a preference for spears<br></li><li>Hamian Archers – famous middle-eastern foot soldiers<br></li><li>Palmyrene Cataphracts – eastern-looking heavy cavalry<br></li><li>Armoured Camels – exotic eastern-style cavalry</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/694880/extras/4.ED_Fighting_2.jpg?t=1540814665\" >",
