Powered by supernatural evil and loaded with military hardware, they scattered us and ran us down.<br><br>But then she came. At first, we thought she was one of them — a woman in black, with a long gun like a witch's broom and the magical powers to match. Survivors whispered her stories in the alleyways: stories of battles so intense that they leveled whole city blocks, during which she mowed down entire demon regiments with flaming bullets, then shared her own blood to save the wounded.
