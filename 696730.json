            "reviews": "“Deep Ones has an interesting visual style with a simplistic feel reminiscent of some earlier titles on the ZX Spectrum, but it gets into deep water with its shifting game modes and dissatisfying controls. Considering the calibre of action-platformers on the eShop at the moment, the game drowns in amongst its competition.”<br>2.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://switchplayer.net/2018/06/01/deep-ones-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Switch Player</a><br><br>“Deep Ones é um jogo de plataforma 2D retro que não tenta inovar, mas cumpre o pouco que promete. Tem comandos lentos pela sua temática e uma arte incrível, mas a repetição de níveis e alguns problemas de jogabilidade pode afastar o jogador da aventura. Seus níveis exigem memorização do que fazer e depois de um tempo você consegue progredir sem problemas. As batalhas contra chefes são as mais divertidas do game. A trilha sonora não é ruim, mas não combina com o jogo, isso incomoda mais ainda em batalhas contra chefes. O preço pequeno de Deep Ones faz com que ele seja uma boa opção para quem procura algumas horas de diversão por um preço leve, mas não é nem de longe um jogo obrigatório para donos do Switch, pois Deep Ones é um game com público bem”<br>50/100 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://switchplayer.net/2018/06/01/deep-ones-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >SwitchBrasil</a><br><br>“Overall, I loved this game! Deep Ones is a great retro arcade platformer that, if you are into that kind of game, everyone should play! And even if you aren’t into platformers or that old school look, you should still check it out on Steam, because it’s a super cheap game and a lot of fun! There is definitely something addicting about this game.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.thegoblingazette.com/deep-ones-game-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Goblin Gazette</a><br>",
