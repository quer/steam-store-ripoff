Twelve of your favorite oozes are here, updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every globbulent horror has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from an mythic id ooze’s psychotropic vapors to a mythic carnivorous blob’s skeletal liquefaction.</i><br><br>This product includes mythic oozes of commonplace varieties like the black pudding and gelatinous cube, as well as variants like the electric jelly and white pudding, made far more distinct in their mythic evolutions, covering CRs from 4 to 16. In addition to a dozen familiar oozy monsters, Mythic Monsters: Oozes also includes suggested alternate rules for dealing with some common ooze abilities as they interact with the mythic rules and mythic characters. To top it all off, Mythic Monsters: Oozes introduces an entirely new 13th mythic ooze, the swift and deadly quicksilver ooze, congealed from the divine forges of the gods themselves.<br><br>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they’ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and “What was THAT?” will warm any GM’s heart.<br><br><i>Conversion by:</i> <strong>Tony Lindberg</strong><br><br>Released on August 11, 2017. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.2.2 and higher.<br><br><strong>Requirements:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included Pathfinder ruleset.",
