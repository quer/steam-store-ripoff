While one player performs his or her shot, the other players have to wait until it's their individual turn.<br></li><li><strong>Simultaneous</strong>: In simultaneous mode, the players make their settings for their next shot simultaneously. After all players have confirmed their individual firing settings, all tanks fire their weapons at the same time. The procedure repeats until only one tank (or only one team) is still alive.<br></li><li><strong>Real-time</strong>: In real-time mode, all players may fire at their own will and at any time, provided that they don't already/still have a projectile flying around. This massacre lasts until only one tank (or only one team) is still alive.</li></ul><br><i>Tank Wars: Anniversary Edition</i> is currently in early access and only supports single-player and local multiplayer matches (&quot;hotseat&quot;).
