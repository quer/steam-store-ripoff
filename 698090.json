Twelve of your favorite eldritch abominations are here, updated for the mythic rules, and when we say updated we mean complete stat blocks, yes, but more than that every unearthly and indescribable Thing from Beyond has its own unique and exciting new mythic abilities, from an mythic shantak’s disemboweling flyby to the temporal retribution of a mythic hound of Tindalos!<br><br>This product includes mythic oozes of familiar alien horrors like the gibbering mouther and shoggoth as well as more obscure alien creatures like the faceless stalker and moon-beast, covering CRs from 4 to 24. In addition to a dozen existing otherworldly foes, Mythic Monsters: Mythos also enumerates every creature from the official Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Bestiaries (and a few more besides) that qualifies for the mythos descriptor, as well as mythic path abilities for alien alchemy and the mysterious Elder Signs, plus four mythic alchemical compounds to spice up the laboratory of your favorite deranged researcher of the cosmos. To top it all off, Mythic Monsters: Mythos introduces an entirely new 13th mythic monster, the swift and deadly mythic greater byakhee, a star-spanning mount, minion, and menace perfect for the summoning rituals of your local cosmic cultists!<br><br><i>The Mythic Monsters series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they’ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and “What was THAT?” will warm any GM’s heart.</i><br><br>Conversion by: Tony Lindberg<br><br>Released on August 13, 2017. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.2.2 and higher.<br><br><strong>Requirements:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included Pathfinder ruleset.",
