They are inside your room, and inside your mind - your dreams and sometimes dreams come true. Freddy Krueger knows the true meaning of haunting. The true meaning of pushing someone into that dream state where you are uncertain whether you are awake or asleep - alive or on the verge of death. Some more than others will resist sleep, like young Quentin, who is forced to head back where Freddy learned about revenge. Back to Badham Preschool.<br><br><strong>Back to school</strong><br>Who would have thought that dreams could actually do harm? Physical, pain inducing harm? Fear and pain stemming from a scarred soul who seeks revenge for a punishment he deserved.

Who will never let you rest and regain some strength so you are able to keep on fighting. Freddy is relentless in his struggle and yearns for retribution. He does not sees the wrongs he did, but rather how he was wronged. He does not hear the cries of pain and suffering children. He just sees his claws closing in on your neck.<br><br><strong>Killer Power - Freddy Krueger: Dream Demon</strong><br><br>Death won't accept him and thus he remains, a calamity, indisputable master of his victims' nightmares. Dream Demon allows The Nightmare to pull Survivors into the Dream World.<br>- Survivors who are awake do not see or hear The Nightmare.<br>- Once targeted by The Nightmare power, Survivors enter the Dream Transition after some time.<br>- During the Dream Transition they can see The Nightmare intermittently.<br>- When the Dream Transition lapses, the Survivor is pulled into the Dream World.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Once in the Dream World: </strong></h2><br>- Survivors' auras are revealed to The Nightmare when they are outside of his terror radius.<br>- Survivors suffer an action speed penalty<br>- To exit the Dream World, Survivors can find other non-sleeping Survivors to perform a wake up action<br>- Some failed actions can wake up the Survivor.<br>- Getting hooked wakes up the Survivor<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/700282/extras/nightmare_killerperks.jpg?t=1541602205\" ><br><br>Freddy comes with <strong>3 new perks</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fire Up</h2>The increased pressure of losing your prey fills you with anger and gives you unsuspected motivation.

Fear poses an option: head into the storm and ride it out, or accept the inevitability of death and just go to bed. Quentin chooses the first one. But how long can he avoid sleep? And how will he manage in this place?
