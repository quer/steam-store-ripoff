The first player to build a castle in a region with mountains, builds a “mountain city”. It is worth two points when counting the control. More cities can be built in a region with mountains, but they are not counted as “mountain cities”.<br>3. Controlling a mountainous region is worth 1 extra victory points (2 instead of 1).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Settlers Card</h2>During your turn you can use the &quot;Settlers&quot; card. It allows you to pay 2 coins to your opponent and use his/her cities, as if they were yours, for the purpose of recruiting troops during the current turn. Once the &quot;Settlers&quot; card has been used, it cannot be used again by any other Player. You may use the &quot;Settlers&quot; card even if you have not selected the troop recruitment action, but you have to pay one of your opponents anyway.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Builders Card</h2>When you complete all of your actions in your turn, you can use the &quot;Builders&quot; card if you have the required goods (goods like “joker” do not count). You must have: 2 carrots, 1 tree, and 1 iron. If you use the &quot;Builders&quot; card, you can build one city immediately. Once the &quot;Builders&quot; card has been used, it may not be used again by anyone.",
