You build a wooden fort, place units, and then watch the battle unfold. To win the game you either have to destroy all of your opponent's units, or capture their flag. Units can be toggled as either &quot;offensive&quot; or &quot;defensive.&quot; When units are designated for offense, they will move towards the enemy flag, engaging any enemy soldiers they encounter along the way. Units designated for defense will stay where you place them, waiting for the enemies to come to them. If there are no more offensive units left on the map, the game enters a tie breaker procedure, where all defensive units are automatically switched to offensive mode, and all forts/blocks disappear to clear the way for the soldiers. The armies from both sides will march towards each other and engage in an epic showdown. Last army standing wins.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/703510/extras/gamemodes.png?t=1545603121\" ><br><br><strong>Missions:</strong><br><br>Missions involve different scenarios against the AI opponent. The objective is to defeat the enemy using a limited amount of resources. Strategic construction of the base, and choice of units is crucial. Carefully planning and executing your strategy is the only way to victory.<br><br><strong>Conquest:</strong><br><br>Conquest mode contains an entire map populated with 5 factions as well as many forts and areas to be captured. The player controls one faction, trains units, deploys armies, and battles the enemy. The goal is to wipe all the factions out by capturing all of their forts and areas.<br><br><strong>Challenges:</strong><br><br>There are 24 challenges in the game, three for each of the infantry units, except the medic. In the challenges you are given limited resources, and can only use the challenge specific unit. The objective of the challenge is to only use the available units to defeat the enemy. Completing the challenges will unlock new weapons for your units. You can view the weapons from the Armory tab in the main menu.<br><br><strong>Wave Survival:</strong><br><br>In Wave Survival, you are pitted against endless waves of enemies. You get more resources and face more enemies with each subsequent wave.<br><br><strong>Sandbox Mode:</strong><br><br>Sandbox mode allows the player to place a large number of units and build up bases for both teams. The player can use this mode to mess around with different units and experiment with different strategies. Sandbox mode also allows user to share their battle on the Steam Workshop.<br><br><strong>Turf War:</strong><br><br>The enemy has 4 unit spawning barracks, your goal is to destroy them before you get overrun with enemy units. Several levels of difficulty are available.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/703510/extras/Units.png?t=1545603121\" ><br><br>The game currently has 13 units: Rifleman, Cannon, Sniper, Musketoon, Medic, Rocketman, Grenadier, Gatling Gun, Officer, Mortar, Rocket Artillery, Musketeer, and Swordsman . Each unit is designed to fill a specific role on the battlefield and making smart unit choices is key to a well balanced army.
