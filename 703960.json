Killers have no distinct uniforms, so stealthy players will force agents to be as sharp and cautious as possible. Be quick and sneaky, or deliver chaos and destroy the opposition, or maybe you will defend the innocent with your life. It's your choice. Every succesful tactic is awarded. But it’s not just you and your gun against the world. You have your teammates and here's where the teamwork makes all the difference. Create diversions, watch hitman's back or stand guarding getaway routes.<br><br><strong>Open enviroments</strong><br>Blend in with the citizens and try to pass by security agents without being recognized. Explore and find the perfect spot to ambush your target. Or choose to defend those citizens instead, investigating, anticipating and countering the killer's actions.<br><br><strong>Multiplayer mode</strong><br>Play with your friends or join a team to create a better strategy and coordinate surveillance, distraction, assault, overwatch and escape plans!",
