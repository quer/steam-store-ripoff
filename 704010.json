LongStory is fiction, but it’s based on real stories - things that have happened, if not to us, to people we know and love. We hope it is funny, sad, perplexing and wonderful… Just like life.",

            "reviews": "“I can’t tell you how real this gameplay felt to me. I was speaking to myself in high school again, carefully playing out a scenario I’d lived before: the slow, terrifying realization that not only was I gay, but the girl that I had a crush on lived thousands of miles away. We connected online, but did that make what I felt any less real? As I played, my hands were shaking. This was real. This was my story. I never expected to have this kind of visceral experience playing an app game, but it felt strangely cathartic all the same.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://femhype.com/2015/02/19/internet-friends-reviewing-longstory-my-queer-past/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >FemHype</a><br><br>“LongStory is doing something radical. It's offering an inclusive alternative to a gaming space that has, for years and years, been dominated by a single narrative—and that hasn't historically been welcoming to diverse players.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mg79ja/this-dating-sim-is-changing-the-game-for-lgbtq-teens-queer-and-trans-teens-are-e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Vice: Motherboard</a><br><br>“The game promotes diversity with a depiction of a functional, vibrant world that undercuts the nightmare scenarios and fearmongering of more conservative opponents, demonstrating that society won’t fall apart with greater recognition for non-conforming identities. It will keep going much as it always has, with people being kind and cruel to each other in roughly the same measure.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/longstory-date-a-turkey-surprisingly-adept-gender-inclusiveness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Playboy</a><br>",
