The fleet of ÖBB 1014s originally worked out of Vienna, however they would soon be seen across Austria, frequently visiting enamouring countries on cross-border passenger and freight services, as well as heading more local duties.<br><br>Despite their success in service, the ÖBB 1014s were also considered a very unnecessary and expensive purchase; with such a small number in operation, the decision was made to retire the fleet in 2009, only half way through their intended service life.
