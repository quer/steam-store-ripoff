In that role you explore a post-apocalyptic, frozen wasteland to gather the resources necessary to establish a refuge for survival. With dwindling resources, simple tasks like upgrading equipment and collecting materials quickly require an expedition to scavenge the necessary items. In the search for survival materials, players must navigate a vast territory, in which they will encounter Eldritch monsters and an even greater foe: the unrelenting winter. While freezing temperatures constantly take their toll on the player Ash, the deadliest event is that of a blizzard. If caught by surprise, it takes every ounce of skill, determination and luck to survive. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/706020/extras/crusher-fight-2.gif?t=1548324660\" ><br><br>In order to survive and overcome all challenges, the player needs to attract followers, bringing them into thei refuge.
