What prey will you hunt? Where will you go? How long will you be out?<br>Often, you’ll want to travel light to decrease weight and stay agile in rough terrain. But other times, you just want to take as much gear as possible and go for longer stretches. To accommodate those epic hunting trips, the reserve wardens have added three new backpacks to the store.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INCREASED INVENTORY CAPACITY</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/706150/extras/description_character.png?t=1527162644\" ><br>The main advantage of getting a backpack is that it increases your inventory space when you are travelling. The increased space gives you the opportunity to take more weapons, ground blinds and/or any items from your storage along on your hunt.

The larger the backpack you carry, the more visible you are to animals and the more noise you make when traveling by foot.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRAILSCOUT MINI DAYPACK</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/706150/extras/description_colours_small.png?t=1527162644\" ><br>This lightweight hunting backpack gives you plenty of room for additional hunting equipment and is available in three different colors: Glacier, Evergreen and Blazing.<br>When downloading the DLC, the Glacier shade is unlocked for purchase in the store for in-game currency.
