In bygone times, monsters sallied from the Mottled Spire’s twisted canyons, their onslaughts only stopped by the brave Dunstonian forces. Now after generations of quiet, the town’s once formidable moat is used by grazing sheep and playing children. The insular community has become peaceful but peace has led the town to become stuck in its old ways. A new ruler seeks to slough of Dunstone’s years of quiet and idleness to usher the town into a new era. Guilds practice their crafts, preparing to send their goods throughout the Duchy of Ashlar. Yet, the Mottled Spire and the environs beyond are never quiet. A vile creature has emerged from Gloamhold’s depths to prey on the unsuspecting townsfolk.</i><br><br><i>By </i><strong>Tommi Salama</strong><br><br><i>Most of Dunstone comprises peasant homes.

A garrison of the Knights of the Eternal Watch also headquarter here, charged with the task of keeping the town safe.<br>Bastion of Peace: Worshippers of Conn gather here, a place that is the heart and soul of the community.<br>Sheep Knuckles: This strange inn sticks out in Dunstone but is a beloved drinking spot for the locals. Various forms of entertainment take place here nightly.<br>The Gilded Swan: One of Dunstone’s most prominent inns, it has secretly been taken over by an intellect devourer. Various hedonistic delights can be had here for a price.<br>Kildann’s Cuts: Renowned for its quality meats, its owner, a wanted fugitive, also offers a special menu comprising the flesh of exotic creatures.<br>Rekola Manor: Once a wizarding school, the manor and family have fallen into decay. Its current patriarch seeks to repair the family’s fortunes.<br>Brandybottle Distillery: This halfling-owned distillery is known for its fine spirits. Its owner, Verna Brandybottle single-handedly started a brewing revival in Dunstone.<br>Fisfelond’s Smithy: An inconspicuous smithy, its aging elven weaponsmith makes renowned weapons for the true of heart or for Dunstone’s protection.<br>Farmer’s Market: The local farmers congregate here to sell produce in a festival-like atmosphere with lively music and fresh beer.<br>Trade Market: The trade market allows various guilds to sell their wares and intermingle.
