It’s a way for our biggest fans to support our future development and to receive all forthcoming R2G games once they become available. <br><br><strong><u>Important:</u></strong> <i>The <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/bundle/4490/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >upgrade bundle</a> will only work for users who already own Book of Demons (the price adjusts automatically so you only need to pay the difference). </i></p><br><h1>What’s R2G and why does it need a Supporter DLC?</h1><p>At Thing Trunk we all have a dream, and this dream is the Return 2 Games series. The vision we have is grand and it has many layers (just like an Ogre). On the most basic level it will be a series of 7 games, each one inspired by a classic PC hit game from the 90’s. But it’s also a vision that games should respect a lot of different types of gamers.<br><br>Are you an enthusiast completionist? A casual gamer ready for something deeper? Or perhaps you don’t like casual games because they lack depth, or you can’t invest enough time to enjoy hardcore games as much as you used to when you were younger? Maybe you just looking for something new that isn’t afraid to experiment and break the rules of some stagnant genre? If any of those questions resonate with you, we think we know the tricks to make our games work for you. And the best part is you don’t take our word for it! Take a look at Book of Demons (it’s got a <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/449960/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >free demo</a>) and see for yourself if it rocks your boat. <br><br>And if you want to learn even more, take a look at our full R2G Manifesto (second movie in the box on the top).<br><br>We’re a small dedicated team at Thing Trunk, and Return 2 Games is our opus magnum. It’s what we’ve been working on since the birth of our studio and what we’ll be hopefully working on in the years to come. Of course we’re not expecting everyone to care as much about the vision behind R2G as we do. It’s perfectly fine to check out Book of Demons demo, buy the game if you like it and wait and see what comes out next in the series. But if you support our passion, our vision and want to help us get one step closer to making it a reality, consider joining our journey and becoming an official R2G Supporter.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/706770/extras/team.png?t=1540200850\" ></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/706770/extras/pillars.png?t=1540200850\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What do I get as an R2G Supporter Today?</h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/706770/extras/heart.png?t=1540200850\" > <strong>Your name featured in the credits</strong> (with the next update of the game)<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/706770/extras/heart.png?t=1540200850\" > You will be taking advantage of the <strong>discounted price</strong>.

We’d love to release a new game every two years, and we’ll strive to do so, but this is something we can’t guarantee. We’re a very small independent team and the development of the first game, Book of Demons, has already taken much longer than we anticipated. And it’s still not 100% complete. We should be able to make following games faster as a lot of the groundwork has already been done while developing Book of Demons; we have the art style, the common R2G launcher, a working pipeline backend tools, for some of the upcoming games we even have already created the animated intro sequences. Since we are self-funded, it will also depend on the level of commercial success Book of Demons achieves once it’s released. If it performs well, we should be able to scale our team and work faster. It it’s not that great it might make bigger business sense for us to port it to other platforms first.<br><br>Either way, this will be a long ride, so please make sure this is something you are comfortable with before deciding to support us.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What about other platforms?</h2><br>Return 2 Games Supporter’s Pack is for Steam supported platforms only. This means PC, Mac (and possibly Linux) builds of the future games. It’s technically not possible for us to sell bundled licenses for other proprietary platforms (like mobile or consoles) so these will be distributed separately should they arrive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What happens if you fail?</h2><br>Another tough one. We’d like to write that failure is not an option, but let’s be real – this is not the case, especially with such an ambitious task at hand. Failure is something we’ll try to avoid at any cost and we’ll take any route that will help us realize the R2G vision. Still, if the games flop and we go down midway, we might not be able to give refunds. We might fail in a way, that it will take forever to complete the series. There’s a few more scenarios we’d consider a failure, but if there is one thing we can promise it’s this - <strong>we’ll do everything in our power not to stumble</strong>. The biggest risk lies just ahead with the release of Book of Demons, but so far judging by the early reviews we’re cautiously optimistic.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How can I help more?</h2><br>If you support our vision and you’d like to help us even more (apart from purchasing the R2G Supporter’s Bundle) below are some things you might do.
