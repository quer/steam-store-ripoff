The most popular horror experience in VR is now available for Steam.<br> <br>“AFFECTED: The Manor” has been completely reworked from the ground up for the latest generation of VR headsets.

No loading save points or getting friends to a “certain” part of a game. Simply strap on the headset and enjoy watching your friends and family navigate “The Manor”.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>AFFECTED: Where It Began</strong></h2> <br>“AFFECTED” was released as a demo in the early days of VR for the Oculus Rift DK1.

Keeping game mechanics to a minimum also enables players with no gaming background to fully enjoy our experience, meaning anybody will be able to play &quot;AFFECTED: The Manor&quot;. <br><br>While many horror games were played during the development of “AFFECTED: The Manor”, the team also visited a number of Live Action Horror Walk-throughs which we felt were nearer to the VR experience that we wanted to create. We learned quickly that having no control over what was happening only heightened the player's anxiety and fear of what was to come next.<br> <br>Audio and lighting also play a pivotal role in “The Manor”. We utilize specialized audio throughout and take control of all lighting elements. So if we want the flashlight to pop off at the worst possible time, then it will. No extra batteries will save you in our experience!<br> <br>You won’t get lost in “The Manor” or have to spend time looking at level maps to navigate your way. If a door is open, then that’s the way to go. Once again we feel that removing the frustrating element of finding keys to open doors really does immerse players deeper into our experience.<br> <br>Oh, and don’t worry, you can’t die in “The Manor”. Replaying parts of a level numerous times cannot only become frustrating, but we found can also desensitize the player to the environment and overall experience.<br> <br>All of the above has shaped “AFFECTED: The Manor” into what it is today; an immersive, easy to play experience that you will want your friends to play as much as you want to play yourself. <br> <br><strong>FOR COMPLETE IMMERSION we recommend you play AFFECTED standing up wearing headphones in a dark room!<br> <br>WARNING: This experience uses Jump Scares!
