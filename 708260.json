The original idea of this game came from the team member Harvey Jackson, and this program was his personal project about the course Visual Poetics and Narrative in his postgraduate period. We were shocked by the visual effect, and so we decided to start this challenging project.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo-player mode and fight with your friend!<br />\r\nThis game supports two players, and quickly invite your friends to challenge it together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSurvival mode<br />\r\nAt the same time, we provide a super difficult survival mode for the veterans of bullet hell, and each round is a purgatory mode.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition, the game is also equipped with a wealth of content expansion.<br />\r\nSteam achievements, leaderboards, full controller support &amp; trading cards!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the meanwhile, we will release more game modes and levels, so please look forward to them!",

Beautiful and dangerous, like a Burmese cat with its paw stuck in the door.”<br />\r\nrockpapershotgun.com<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Welcome to letter hell, folks! Text Wormhole‘s alphabetic twist on bullet hell chaos is a novel test of hand-eye coordination, pattern memorization, and visual recognition. This isn’t a game you’ll necessarily want to play for stretches longer than, say, 10 to 15 minutes at a time, but in short bursts the game proves to be hellacious fun. Overall this is a gaming dollar very well spent.”<br />\r\nvgblogger.com<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Text Wormhole’s letter swarms are a delight to see in motion. Combined with the adrenaline-pumping soundtrack and frantic bullet hell letter dodging it makes for an intense and very addictive experience that has that all important ‘just one more go’ factor. A super cool bullet hell letter ’em up.”<br />\r\nAlphabetagamer.com<br />\r\n",
