The unique features of each figure make the gameplay special.<br>Pass 3 campaign seasons in a single or co-op mode or play with a friend in a speed competition.

You can boast of them in competitive multiplayer or exchange with other players, as well as sell them on the trading platform.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features of the game:</h2> - Unique physical characteristics of the figures, each of which has a number of advantages. Use a bunch of two figures to achieve better results.<br>- 3 various offline seasons, unique tournament levels with original design, local competition mode with own maps and rules for two players, competitive levels for multiplayer with unique traps and style.<br>- 20 levels of two difficulty types (easy and hard) multiplied by 3 non-repeating settings - pass the levels, get into the table of leaders and fight for the best time.<br>- Monthly tournaments will give you the opportunity to receive legendary skins and trails for your figures, some of which are animated. Which gives them incredible value.<br>- Equip your figures for each season in the menu of presets, craft new items of a higher rarity from the old unnecessary ones, sort and select the best skins through inventory filters.<br>- Compete with your friend locally in '1 vs 1' mode or pass the levels together in a local co-op.<br>- Compete online against other players, choose figures, wear skins and go into battle on random maps which one-armed bandit will choose. Prove that your skill is better, that your trails and skins cost you.<br>- Create and edit levels through the built-in editor, which allows to upload your own level to the workshop. You can also use your graphics to create maps.<br>- Upload someone else's maps from the Steam Workshop, leave a reviews and ratings to other users, pass their maps and earn prizes just for playing.<br>- We launched the distribution of promo-safes and promo-keys: they drop out just during the game absolutely free of charge - now everyone can afford quality items for nothing.
