            "detailed_description": "<strong>7 Bones and 7 Stones - The Ritual</strong> is an asymmetrical (4v1) multiplayer game set in a medieval fantasy realm, called Vayandor. <br><br>One player takes the role of a powerful monster called upon this land by a dark portal, and four other players play as villagers that try to close the portal and cleanse the land of evil by completing an ancient ritual.<br><br>The monster uses his unique trait and abilities to hunt down the scared villagers in an attempt to prevent the ritual from ever completing. The villagers search the forest for ancient ritual stones while trying to hide and run from the monster.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><br><br><strong> Rich Progression</strong>  - Playing is always fun, but being rewarded for playing is even better. Players engage with the game even more by leveling up skills, gaining new titles, unlocking cosmetic items and much more. <br><br><strong> No Player Elimination</strong>  - Being eliminated from a match early may motivate some players to get better at the game but can also create frustration and down time. The game is designed in such way that there is always something you can do to turn the tables and win the match. There’s always hope as long as you play your cards right. <br><br><strong> Terrorize the Realm!</strong>  - Bring terror in Vayandor and try to master each dark creature while hunting the scared villagers. Each monster has its own gameplay and brings its own challenges while also presenting a weakness that the unworthy villagers will make sure to exploit. <br><br><strong> Play with Friends</strong>  - What's more fun than running scared in a fantasy forest with your friends? Bring your friends and cleanse the land of Vayandor together. Work as a team and try to complete objectives while also saving your best friends from the impending doom.<br><br><strong> A Bright Future</strong>  - There’s a lot of room to grow and I can't wait to have everyone involved in the process. I plan on adding new monsters, new maps, new cosmetics and much more content and features. <br><br><strong> Made with Passion</strong>  - This is a game made with much love and passion and if you are looking to have fun in a tight community I strongly invite you to stay a night in Vayandor. Don't let the bedbugs bite!",
