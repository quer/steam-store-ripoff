Then study the anatomy of eyes, nose, lips, and ears. The information is presented in an entertaining way to keep you engaged and willing to re-watch the lessons.\r\n\r\nIncludes 2 full length, real-time demonstrations of how to take a portrait from start to finish. You’ll also get pics of 3D models that you can use to practice and study from. Mini-lessons in the course are the same as the free versions, not extended.\r\n\r\nTotal Runtime: 7 Hours 30 Minutes\r\n\r\nWhat You’ll Learn\r\n\r\nLoomis Method: Learn how to use the Loomis Method for constructing the 3d forms of the head. This allows you to draw the head in any angle from your imagination or from life.\r\n\r\nEyes: Learn the anatomy and how to draw realistic eyes step by step. Being able to draw realistic eyes brings your portraits to life.\r\n\r\nNose: Learn to draw the nose by deconstructing it into major and minor planes. This will help you to shade the forms and make the nose pop from the page.\r\n\r\nLips: Give your portraits luscious lips by starting with 5 squishy little pillows and then rendering the 3-dimensional forms using tone.\r\n\r\nEars: Learn how to manage the complexity of the ear with the “Y?” method. You’ll also learn “shadow mapping” to design the light and dark patterns of the shadows.\r\n\r\nHair: Most people approach hair the wrong way. In this course, you’ll learn how to give hair volume in your drawings. No more spaghetti hair!\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\nStep by Step Instruction: Receive step by step instruction on drawing each facial feature. Learn each one at your own pace and then put them all together at the end to complete a portrait.\r\n\r\nReal Time Demos: Most of us are visual learners (we’re artists!), so hearing it explained is not enough. We have to see it many times. You’ll get access to real-time versions of the demonstrations so you can observe the process as it is and learn pencil control and technique.\r\n\r\n3D Models: Students have access to rotating 3D models that they can use to practice and study from. Both Male and Female skulls and a Loomis Head are included in the course.\r\n\r\nFull Demonstrations: Includes 2 full length, real-time demonstrations of how to take a portrait from start to finish. You’ll learn how the whole process, including the layin and shading.",
