From there, you must fight off hoards of Kyztlings - small, malleable aliens which obey no higher power than their Hive Master. <br><br>Every so often, you are forced to decide between making your enemies stronger, faster or tougher. Whichever you choose will immediately augment the Kyzt forces, causing them to become more effective in their advances. <br><br>Supplies are sparse on planet Ky, so it's very difficult to get a chance to recover any damage that you take. However, Kyztlings are an excellent source of Special Energy. Special Energy won't heal you, but it is able to be used as ammunition for more powerful shots. Some forms of Special Energy are known to have unusual effects on your weapon, so stay alert!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Regarding the demo:</strong></h2><br>The demo  is on its way!
