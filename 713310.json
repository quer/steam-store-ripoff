You control the Gambol Gumball through a gauntlet of levels designed with flow and rhythm in mind to test your platforming grit.  But don't be too nervous, because along with the slick controls you also have a triple jump that's energy is reset upon touching any (non-lethal) surface, including the ceiling.  Holy cow, that sounds great.  The controls are simple enough that you could play it on a NES controller, with only run, jump, left, right, down-boost, and [REDACTED] to worry about. What's that “[REDACTED]” all about?  Hah, don't think too much about it, it's probably nothing.<br><br><br>      “Whoa!” you say, “this looks crazy hard, is this one of those games that Poo-Dee-Pah yells at on the YouVideo?”  Nah, it's not too bad, the levels appear a bit tougher than they really are since I had to put in more obstacles to make up for all that sweet, juicy, player agency you have. Oh, and when you inevitably meet your demise at the hands of a spike, laser, bomb, floating-shock-ball-of-hurt, or whatever else, you re-spawn within a couple seconds (or just hit the level-restart button if you're fidgety like me), so it's no biggie if you have to re-run a level a few times before you get the hang of it.  But for all you hardcore platforming buffs out there, I've made a second, harder difficulty with special levels, and normal mode levels with more hazards added.
