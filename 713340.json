You both have countless accomplishments and are well known galaxy-wide. It is time to set course for a celestial body that you and your pal have heard over last-night's outing at the Spacebar n Grill; the only problem here is that your budget was very small when purchasing a space ship... What does it matter anyways? As long as it can move and hold enough oxygen on board, you two should be fine, right?\r\n\r\nWithin your space ship, there are 7 stations. These stations all do one specific job that contributes to keeping you, your space buddy and all your hopes and dreams alive. Therefore, it would be best to maintain all the stations. This is obviously easier said than done. Some stations will eventually break down due to unknown reasons and it is up to you two to fix them! If the ship's structural integrity hits 0% or the O2 levels hit 0%, you are dead. It's game over. Rack up points by making repairs and see how far you and your buddy can make it.\r\n\r\nCONTROLLERS RECOMMENDED\r\n\r\nThe game is still in need of more features to make the gameplay more smooth, including menu navigation.",
