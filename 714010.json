According to Aim Lab ’s internal metrics, I raised my pistol accuracy from 67 percent to 77 percent and my rifle accuracy from 28 percent (yes, I’m that bad) to 60 percent. That feels like a dramatic improvement for a casual player using a beta version of the software for less than two hours.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3k7zwj/these-neuroscientists-think-they-can-help-you-get-more-headshots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Motherboard</a><br>",
