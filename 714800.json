Although half of the town's citizens support the building of such a mill, the other half fear the potential for pollution and contamination of their beloved river. Recognizing Ohitoyo's budgetary decline over the last few decades, Sotetsu believes that the town requires a system that allows it to be fiscally independent instead of reliant upon a factory to stimulate its economy, and sets out to identify an alternative method in achieving this goal. It's during this time that Sotetsu comes across an android-like being--a &quot;Raillord&quot; named Hachiroku--while looking through his late adoptive father's belongings. Although inanimate, Hachiroku and Sotetsu forge a deep, unlikely connection, and from this bond, work together in hopes of restoring Ohitoyo to its former glory.<br><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/714800/extras/characters_rounded.png?t=1548808506\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/714800/extras/Hachiroku_rounded.png?t=1548808506\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/714800/extras/Paulette_rounded.png?t=1548808506\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/714800/extras/Hibiki_rounded.png?t=1548808506\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/714800/extras/Reina_rounded.png?t=1548808506\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/714800/extras/features_rounded.png?t=1548808506\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Fully voiced in Japanese including the protagonist!<br></li><li>Includes dual language support<br></li><li>Fully animated sprites and events<br></li><li>Scene select to jump to your favorite in game scenes<br></li><li>Includes tips for detailed information about trains and the game<br></li><li>A gallery to pose character stands, listen to in game music, view CGs, and view scenes</li></ul>",
