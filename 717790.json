You might encounter hunters and animals that you'll have to fight with to claim resources and expand building capabilities. Since launching, we've added quests in single-player and a NEW multiplayer mode without quests. <br><br>We wanted to make a survival game that’s not about feeling like you are on the verge of dying, while fighting off and defending your base. In Hold Your Own it’s easier to find food and water, but AI is harder to kill and coming after you. We want players to have fun, build their base so they can spend their time on fun quests and killing AI.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Key Features</strong>: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single or Multiplayer mode<br></li><li>Character Hunger, Thirst, Body Temperature Mechanics, weather systems <br></li><li>Base Building<br></li><li>Ferry Mechanics to travel from one island to another<br></li><li>Hunting <br></li><li>Crafting Items<br></li><li>Food Cooking Mechanics<br></li><li>Power/Electricity Mechanics<br></li><li>Gathering Resources <br></li><li>Mining and refining of ores<br></li><li>Quests<br></li><li>Trader<br></li><li>Arms Dealer<br></li><li>Kill AI Enemies <br></li><li>Animal Husbandry <br></li><li>Farming<br></li><li>Day/Night Cycle<br></li><li>Weather Cycle </li></ul><br><br>The graphics and quality of the game are our most important priority during Early Access.

So only support this game if you are willing to<u> bear with us</u> (and want to kill bears as well) and believe in what we're trying to accomplish.  Which is to say that, at the end of this long road ahead, we're going to make a game that is a different take on the whole survival genre.
