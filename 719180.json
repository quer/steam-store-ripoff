Imagine if the classic fps had evolved in a direction other than a story based experience, to being something much more brutal, with more advanced gameplay mechanics. Revulsion takes classic Doom and Quake style gameplay and combines it with the core concepts that permeate the Dark Souls design philosophy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will navigate both hand crafted and randomly generated level design to unravel a series of increasingly more dangerous environments. If you die, you will have one chance to recover your dropped credits and loot, or it will be erased forever. Revulsion is a game that is meant to challenge you without being unfair.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRevulsion also includes light RPG elements such as leveling, crafting and upgrading your equipment. In addition to that, there is a large amount of potential loot that you can discover to help you along the way. Weapons, armor, and even special abilities that are tied to limited resources. You will have the ability to craft items from blueprints, as well as repairing broken items that you may find throughout the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExploration is key, as you will be searching all over the world to discover as many secrets as possible. You never know what you might find as you unearth the deepest darkest depths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow far can you get?",
