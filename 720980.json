In the face of such a broad new world, she was surprised, wavered, and her eyes were opened on the impulse of curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s name: Sana. She was born and raised at a facility called the “Laboratory” without ever knowing anything about the outside world. This girl has the special power to materialize anything she imagined. Those with special powers like Sana were called “Alice’s Dream.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, in this new world on the outside, the girl met an elderly man. His name: Zoroku Kashimura. The elderly man was a stubborn one who hated “incorrect things” and would not budge from his opinion of “bad things are bad.” Sana’s meeting with Zoroku would greatly change her destiny.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious organization that is hunting Sana down, other Alice’s Dreams that appear one after another, and kind people that Sana encounters... By going through the looking glass, “Alice,” a girl who knows little to nothing about society, learns about the true form of the world.\r\n\r\n...Yes. This is a story of when I was still freely able to go to the dream world.",
