You'll be able to control its movements and experience safely what it's like to time travel : explore, make friends, work, fight, upgrade your skills and die.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">+ Roguelike</h2>Like in <strong>roguelike</strong> games, if your avatar dies, your game is lost for ever. If you want to play again, you'll need to create a brand new avatar in the year 3571. Be careful: you'll be sent in a very different version of the Earth to avoid spacetime paradoxes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">+ First-person shooter</h2>Thanks to a third-person camera drone, you can see your avatar's body while playing. At any time you can also activate an internal camera, and see exactly what your avatar sees. If you find a gun, the gameplay will feel like a <strong>first-person shooter</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">+ Survival</h2>As you will experience hunger and thirst you'll need to collect food and water to survive, like in most <strong>survival</strong> games. Hunt, fish, find fruits or even steal: do whatever it takes to keep your avatar alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">+ Open-World Sandbox</h2>3571 The Game is also a <strong>sandbox simulation</strong>. You can also gather resources like wood or stone to build weapons, armors and even buildings. The game have no other goal except surviving, so you are free to explore the world like you want and set your own goals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">+ Micromanagement</h2>3571 The Game is also meant to be a very simple kind of <strong>micromanagement game</strong>.
