Throughout the night children from the apartment complex's annual Trick-or-Treat fest come knocking on his door. The player must survive the night in his apartment by keeping lights turned off and silencing any noises. Mr. Norris cannot have his position in the community compromised over such a small Halloween festivity. As the night goes on, it becomes, strangely, increasingly difficult to do so. Strange things begin to happen as the clock ticks down to the end of the night. Is this his own daughter coming back to haunt him? Or something much more sinister?
