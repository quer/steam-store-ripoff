Tensions rise as things start to take turn for the worse and it becomes clear that their unfortunate situation is not an accident, but a trap of elaborate design. Revealing the identity of its creator and understanding their motives is now the matter of life and death.<br><br>The story unfolds from perspective of five different characters, and although you can only unlock routes in succession, your actions and choices in each of them have universal effect and lead to one of four different endings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SETTING</h2><br><br>We created our own universe with blackjack and hook... sorry, demons and penguins. We called it The Universe of Seven. It's a very detailed science fantasy world with its own history, geography, rulebook and characters. We hope that Minotaur will be the first in a series of games set in U7. Other U7 projects we're currently working on are Red Crown, a novel scheduled for 2018 and a prequel to Minotaur, and a board game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">...</h2><br><br>We hope you like Minotaur demo.
