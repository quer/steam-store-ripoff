            "reviews": "“The game was stimulating visually, audibly and mentally. I really enjoyed the story telling. It felt like the sort of thing one might see in the actual television program. The end especially felt right for a Doctor Who story. I believe fans will really appreciate the way the characters are portrayed and the manner in which the story is told. I also think puzzle game enthusiasts are really going to love this style of game. The game was quite challenging, sometimes too challenging for me, but I still really enjoyed it. I loved the ability to switch from one strategy to another from puzzle to puzzle. It was a really unique puzzle experience that I've not seen utilised in other games.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thegallifreytimes.co.uk/2018/08/review-of-doctor-who-infinity-dalek.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Gallifrey Times</a><br><br>“The Lady of the Lake has so much poetry in its narrative and still manages to explore serious topics, such as being a stranger in town/on the planet, being hunted, being lonely, searching for a purpose in life… It is quite amazing to see how close this story is to an actual Doctor Who episode. It might be a video game, but it contains all ingredients to be a powerful story. I found myself fearing for the characters’ safety, or moved by what happened to them (no spoilers here!).”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thegallifreytimes.co.uk/2018/08/review-of-doctor-who-infinity-lady-of.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Gallifrey Times</a><br><br>“Overall, The Dalek Invasion of Time is a fantastic start to Doctor Who Infinity. Since it was first announced, story was heavily marketed as a key feature of the games, and I can see why. While the gameplay is more refreshing than what we’ve seen in Doctor Who Legacy, it’s the story and the presentation that’s the main draw for this series.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://doctorwhowatch.com/2018/08/08/doctor-who-infinity-review-the-dalek-invasion-of-time/2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Fansided</a><br>",
