Changes to the Su-33 include strengthened landing gear, folding wings, more powerful engines, and the very visible canards.<br><br>The Su-33 is equipped with a powerful pulse doppler radar and an Infrared Search and Track (IRST) for engaging aerial targets with a wide range of radar- and infrared-guided missiles and its internal cannon. For air-to-surface attack, the Su-33 can be armed with many types of unguided bombs, rockets, and cluster munitions.<br><br>Despite its large size, the Su-33 is very capable in a dogfight when combined with its integral helmet-mounted sight and off-boresight missiles.<br><br>NOTE: THIS IS THE EXACT SAME SU-33 AS IS INCLUDED IN DCS FLAMING CLIFFS 3.<br><br><strong>This product is not compatible with the DCS World e-Shop version.</strong><br><br>Key Features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Professional Flight Model (PFM).<br></li><li>Virtual Reality supported.<br></li><li>Highly accurate and detailed external model and cockpit.<br></li><li>Wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, including internal cannon.<br></li><li>Modeling of electronic countermeasures and radar warning receiver.<br></li><li>Realistic modeling of carrier landing approach system.<br></li><li>Detailed and accurate simulation of the wing control surfaces that include the leading and trailing edge flaps and the differential ailerons.
