Keep adding poses until you create a full movie that solves the level.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/726880/extras/greenlight_cartel_how_to_play.png?t=1550441410\" ><br>Each level poses a challenge that you have to overcome. For this, you need to create animations that vary in length. From short and simple animations on the first levels to complex and long movies in the last levels.<br><br>Since you'll be creating an entire animation, you'll have complete control of which part of the movie you want to modify. Pause the movie at any point, and add a pose. A pose is just like a keyframe, so the character knows that it has to reach that pose in that specific moment.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/726880/extras/description_timeline.png?t=1550441410\" ><br><br>After a pose has been created, move the character's limbs to any position. You may go for stylish movements, ninja movements, or whatever works for you! When you pose the character a projection will let you know what will happen in the near future. Use that projection to find the right movement.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/726880/extras/description_movement_60.png?t=1550441410\" ><br><br>If you are happy with it, move on!
