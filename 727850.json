Good melee games are somewhat rare in this shooting game era, so Elderborn is going to have a big chance to shine brightly.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.windowscentral.com/elderborn-pc-preview-hack-and-slash-game-i-never-knew-i-wanted\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Windows Central</a><br><br>“Elderborn is a title that deserves peoples attention for its minimalist style and ability to imbue the player with a sense of power and badassery using only music and awesome weaponry.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://cogconnected.com/preview/elderborn-pax-west-preview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Cog Connected</a><br><br>“Elderborn is a game intended for players who love slashers, but also for people who need to release their stress after a difficult day - what works better than kicking an undead into the abyss?
