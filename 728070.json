The ocean is beautifully realized with waving kelp forests, open expanses of water, deep sea caves, and plenty of sea life. In the first stage I felt an overwhelming feeling of exposure, like I was somewhere I shouldn’t be. It’s very effective.  The best learning experiences are often those where you don’t know you’re learning, and Operation Apex’s conservational message is sufficiently subtle to not be the sole reason for the game’s existence, while at the same time provoking thought. It’s a complex juggling act that Curiscope has managed well.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/shark-virtual-reality-curiscope-operation-apex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Andy Boxall, Digital Trends</a><br><br>“Where Apex really sets itself apart is with its bait system. While some wildlife can be scanned with ease, others need to be lured over with the relevant types of food. You create the bait using holographic projections known as mimics, which you’ll gain when you scan creatures. To attract a tuna, for example, you’ll first have to scan a smaller swarm of fish that look tasty, like sardines. Crucially, the mechanics behind Apex are simple fun. Scanning a group of fish means maintaining a distance close enough for your scanner while also far enough away not to scare the fish, and you’ll have to scan multiple specimens very quickly, otherwise you’ll need to start over...Operation Apex is a great example of how VR can be used for good, make an impact and yet still provide the same simple thrills of a solid videogame. Fallout 4 VR may be about to drop hours of content onto your HTC Vive but, in many ways, this is a much better demonstration of what VR is really capable of.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://uploadvr.com/hands-operation-apex-like-blue-planet-game-vr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Jamie Feltham, UploadVR</a><br><br>“Even though I’ve now completed the “quest” I can see myself going back and just enjoying the experience some more… there’s a sense of peace to be had in the depths away from other concerns.
