Reversed cards and ‘Pairs’ with others cards are also found. All these details are explained easily and quickly in your own native language: English, Greek, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZoom and examine each card. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes a card looks really amazing and you might want to zoom in and get a closer look. No problem, just tap the card and zoom/move it around for as long as you like.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n► 4 card spreads: The simple one, the professional Celtic cross spread (10 cards), a detailed Romance spread (7 cards) and a detailed Career spread (7 cards).<br />\r\n► 4 card decks (total 4x78 HD cards), both Trumps and Suits. The ‘Noblet’ historic deck made in 1650 (one of the earliest decks of the Tarot of Marseilles), the ‘Dodal’ deck from 1715 and the famous ‘Conver ‘deck from 1760 (one of the most popular early Marseilles decks).<br />\r\n► Compare each card from all 4 decks at the same time, while zooming. (Access the zoom screen by clicking the top left icon)<br />\r\n► Register up to 3 different users in the same App. Save readings for all 3 users (3x6=18 saves).",
