I had the objective of making a flying game, but when I tested some free-flying game mechanics, I felt some motion sickness! So, rather than making a game where the player can freely fly and turn and spin, I chose to pursue a game where the player is constantly advancing forward. This makes Rocketboarder, in some strange way, <strong>a VR descendant of classic space shooters</strong>.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/730170/extras/RocketboarderGif.gif?t=1561065164\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Steer the board with your body </h2><br>To play Rocketboarder, you plant your feet in a wide stance and calibrate the center of your head. Lean left and the board drifts left, lean right and the board drifts right. Crouch downward and your board swoops down; stand up with your hands to the sky to fly upward.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Body Avatar even with no Trackers</h2><br>Since the player is supposed to play with their feet planted, the in-game foot location combined with the tracked location of the head and controllers can be used to position a virtual avatar. It's not perfect but it should give a cool effect! (Turn the body on in the Game Options menu) <br><br>Despite not requiring body-trackers for body presence, <strong>you CAN use 2 or 3 Vive Trackers to enhance the body tracking</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DIY Motion Rig if you dare?</h2>Have you ever wanted to have your own motion rig? Do you have a Vive Tracker that you don't know what to do with? Make yourself a DIY balance board to control the game! But you absolutely should have a friend there to catch you if you try that! (Note that this might not work simultaneously with the body trackers) More info soon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Follow-up to The Path of Greatest Resistance</h2>The Machine Alliance is has returned! This game is a follow-up to The Path of Greatest Resistance, (but no need to play that game before you play this one.)<br><br>There's only 1 intro tutorial mission and 4 missions that are right now based on the same procedural template level. Keep in mind that this isn't a full-priced game and I hope people can enjoy it for what it is!",
