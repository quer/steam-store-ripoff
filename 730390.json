The environment is inspired by the medieval architecture of Rajasthan, which was the pinnacle of architectural achievement during the medieval era of India.<br><br>This inspired us and thus the art style naturally went down a route of hand painting each and every texture, which can be reflected in every pixel of the game. All thanks to our environment artist, since she comes with a Fine Art background and special expertise that suits the game.<br>​<br> <br><strong>Unique Character Artstyle</strong><br><i>Reflecting Southeast Asia in an Indian game</i><br> <br>Our character art style reflects inspiration from Southeast Asia, the art team went to Bali, Indonesia to study more about the mythology and the background of the island. The art team were heavily influenced by the demonic statues and sculptures that were later infused within the characters of the game.<br><br>​<br><strong>A Story Of Siblings</strong><br><i>A sister on a rescue mission, against all odds</i><br> <br>Raji: An Ancient Epic takes you through an intense and emotional story of Raji, who is determined to find her brother and bring peace to the human realm. The story of Raji: An Ancient Epic is a witness of how Raji evolves through the atrocities of war and the loss of loved ones. She takes upon herself to find an end to this reckless war, which can only happen if she manages to break down the might and the stratagem devised by the great lord of demons, Mahabalasura.<br><br> <br><strong>Gritty and Fluid Combat</strong><br><i>Choose your weapons and gods</i><br> <br>The combat of the game offers a mix of fluidity in movement and attacks going against powerful and mystical enemies. The combat is empowering, making one feel like a demigod, but beware, her vulnerability as a human is never far away. The game offers you choices from various weapons as well as god powers gifted to Raji allowing for diversity and letting the player explore their own style of gameplay. Raji will also come across several demon types and subtypes, including mini bosses and epic boss battles.<br> <br> <br><strong>Through the Ranks Of The Enemy</strong><br><i>The bad and the ugly</i><br><br>All the demons in the game have their ranks among the army. While Raji can come across a demon from a specific race who gripped a stone mace, she might meet the same demon type later with full fledged armor and advanced weaponry. Not only that, one will come across well equipped demons, several subtypes with varying abilities and mini bosses that can be found lurking in the game.<br> <br> <br><strong>Explore Ancient Forts and Solve Environment Puzzles</strong><br><i>Forts and Fortresses, secret locations, puzzles and environment storytelling</i><br> <br>The story of the game takes you through various levels which were inspired by gigantic forts of the medieval era, built by Rajput kings of Rajasthan. Not only that these forts allow for tightly packed arenas for combat they also take the player through the massive scale and breathtaking views the forts provide. The levels will also feature secret locations where one might wonder, what would they stumble upon..friend or foe, treasure or trap?<br> <br>Each of the handcrafted levels will ask the player to surpass challenges one after another. Various “Mandala” puzzles play an important role in environment storytelling, these were designed to give the player a breather in-between the challenging combat. Certain level locations will be telling their own story, which is upto the players to decipher, our artists and level designer has made these locations keeping in mind the context of the level and the lore of the universe.<br><br> <br><strong>Myths and Culture</strong><br><i>A grand game which inspires from Hindu and Bali mythology</i><br> <br>The setting of the game allows us to seep in small fragments of Hindu and Bali mythology here and there. Various level locations, demons, bosses and characters will be representing distinctive features which draw inspiration from both Hindu and Bali mythology. The team at Nodding Heads Games wants the world to be a witness of the grandeur and bizarreness of a game coming from India, which has never been seen in the gaming industry to date.",
