Ranno the Poisonous Pacifist is the third Rival representing the water element while Clairen, the Flame's Salvation, represents Fire.

But now he prefers to peacefully protect his swampy homeland. When he has no other option, you can see glimpses of his rapid and deliberate strikes. Combine his training with his poisonous nature and you have a real threat on your hands.<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>POISON STACKS - Ranno’s Specials Strong Attacks and Jab Combo apply up to four poisonous stacks on his opponents. These stacks damage opponents when they attack and can be removed by hitting Ranno.<br></li><li>TOXIC TRAP - Ranno’s Neutral Special and Down Special can place his opponents in a Toxic Bubble Trap that makes it easier for Ranno to combo. The length of time in the trap depends on the number of Poison Stacks on the opponent.<br></li><li>POISON SPIN - Ranno’s recovery onto stage has three options. He begins it with a Poison Lunge that is quick and knocks opponents away. After the lunge he can quickly Poison Kick down onto the stage with another quick strike.

After being defeated by a tyrannical and ever-living emperor, she travels back in time in order to defeat him. She stands out from the rest of the roster with her deadly sword and her ability to manipulate plasma.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>IONIZED TIP - Unlike the other soldiers from the future, Clairen manipulates her blade to be two-toned. The end of Clairen's sword is super-charged, allowing her to stun enemies who are hit precisely with the tip. <br></li><li>PLASMA ECHO - Clairen dashes forward with her Side Special to quickly escape. The deadly plasma resonance left behind can damage enemies and even KO opponents with its sweet spot.<br></li><li>ENERGY FIELD - Performing a Down Special right before an attack hits Clairen will trigger her energy field.
