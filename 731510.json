As evil energy weighs heavy on the atmosphere, a chasm opens and births what can only be described as a malignant structure of pure hate.

Welcome to… The Scrungeon Depths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Scrungeon Depths is an over the top, ludicrously randomly generated rogue like madhouse. Wade through the body parts of defeated foes to crawl ever deeper and seek answers to the mysteries held within. Only the strong (and slightly insane) will survive.   <br />\r\n<br />\r\nINSANE- First lets start off by saying how bananas The Scrungeon Depths truly is. The amount of random number generation that actually runs this entire universe is out of control. Only the strong willed will survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNEVER ENDING- Some prefer a neatly wrapped package. Others live on the wild side and tear a present open hoping for more than socks. Scrungeon is more than socks. Though, socks do ward off damaging floor traps...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINTENSE- Intensity can sometimes be a bad thing, but when baddies are afoot, nothing could be further from the truth! Fight fast and furiously. Don't break your screen, though.",
