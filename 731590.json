            "reviews": "“A gorgeous FPS that blurs a Hotline Miami palette with a grindhouse art style, a Quake-in-CGA aesthetic and a general vibe of lucid divebar nightmare, this was one that made me sit up and pay attention from the very first frame... The enemies are nasty in all the right ways, the weapons are straight out of some forgotten b-movie and the music sounds like that nightmare sex room out the back of the Roadhouse bar in Twin Peaks... Genuinely, this feels both like a lost early 90s treasure and a real 2017 original”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/11/03/best-new-indie-games-steam-nov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock Paper Shotgun</a><br><br>“Here’s an FPS with an interesting, albeit garish, retro sensibility... I think we can all agree that using a pentagram and crucifix as a reticule is insanely good and worth the price alone.”<br><a href=\"http://www.pcgamer.com/new-steam-games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a><br><br>“If you’re a fan of the surreal, yet hilarious, Machete films by Robert Rodriguez, you’ll love Midnight Ultra’s beautiful grindhouse art style. The mix of classic gunshot sound effects and western background music will tease out your inner cowboy.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://pcgamesn.com/free-steam-keys-midnight-ultra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PCGamesN</a><br>",
