Treasury of the City brings you three dozen brand-new magic items perfect for every part of the city, from the back alleys, sewers, and slums, to the halls of power and the smoke-filled back rooms where power brokers rule from the shadows. You’ll find weapons and combat accessories like the toxic scabbard and forgetful sap alongside protective devices like cryptwarden’s plate and the roofrunner’s buckler. Delvers into the dank byways beneath the city will love ratty robes and the sewer suit, while those accustomed to high places will love the lecturer’s staff, senator’s stole, and the scale of endless bureaucracy! Criminals will find handy devices like pilferer’s gloves and the cheater’s hat, while officers of the law wield the mark of the authority, nightwatch crossbow, and the inspector’s bullhorn to bring them to justice! Wherever your heroes venture in adventures of urban intrigue, they’ll find the perfect tools to take down treacherous advisers and bring justice to the streets.
