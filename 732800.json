Hiding under objects will give you shelter from seagulls.</strong> Or you can go on the offense with exploding turtle poo or with baby turtle calls. That's right, little baby turtle exploding poo, because that's how it is. You can also use turtle calls to find food and go on the offensive. Either way strategy is key because like a real baby turtle, you only have one life.<br><br>As a tiny baby turtle <strong>getting stuck on objects is a possibility</strong> and means certain death as you become helpless.
