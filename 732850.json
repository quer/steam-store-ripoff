            "detailed_description": "Sector Assault is a revolution of the classic formula pioneered by Asteroids. In this inspired twist, your mission isn't to smash rocks, but to challenge an enemy armada with weapons and tactics as extensive as your own. Your battle across the sector will include...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">15 Powerful Loadout Options</h2><br>Wield any combination of four weapons and equipment. Fire swarms of missiles, get up close and personal with the Scattershot, or zap enemies from behind cover with Chain Lightning. Equipment expands your offensive capabilities while also providing utility and defense. Teleport, stun high-priority targets, and even cloak yourself in an aura that increases ramming damage. That's right - melee combat in a space shooter!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Enemy Fleet with 16 Unit Types</h2><br>The opposing fleet is vast and includes everything from phased cruise missiles to raiders that teleport in and out of play. Evade mobile mines and sweeping laser beams as you exchange fire with heavily armed and armored juggernauts. Even the rank-and-file boast special attacks, giving them the power to fill your screen with energy bolts. Your greatest challenge of all may come from supercharged enemies - upgraded versions of normal units that fire their special attacks repeatedly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">30 Waves of Finely Crafted Mayhem</h2><br>Experience some of the most meticulously designed waves in gaming. Enemies are capable of warping in at all angles and distances, allowing them to support each other in formation or surround you without warning. Further testing your reflexes are the endless combinations that make it possible for enemies to cover each other's weaknesses or overwhelm with brute force. Rest assured that even in the most chaotic moments, spawn rates are carefully controlled for a smooth and satisfying pace.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Stunning Beauty of Deep Space</h2><br>Sector Assault's 30 backgrounds have been carefully selected and tweaked from thousands of randomly generated combinations. Each one is streaked with vivid nebulas and further enhanced by parallaxing to create a mesmerizing sense of depth. Rounding out the game's atmosphere are perfectly curated music and sound effects handpicked with even more care than backgrounds.<br><br>Choose your loadouts wisely, adapt faster than your enemy, and achieve victory in your mission to secure the sector!",
