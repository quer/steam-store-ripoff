The 'studio' consists of myself, my brother (artist) and our buddy (musician).

Game mechanics are deceptively complex.  It's a runner, so movement is limited to avoiding obstacles.  The player assigns 6 skills to the skill bar (from a total of 36 unlockable) all with different synergies, strengths and weaknesses.  Combat is one enemy at a time and fast paced.  Some skills require a high skill cap, some are more spammable, and they all work differently together.
