            "detailed_description": "<h1>How is this different from the web game?</h1><p>Prosperity started off as a text based web game that I developed in 2014. Over time, the web version of the game diverged a great deal from my original vision for the game. Many of the things I wanted to do became unrealistic due to the limitations of the game's architecture and planning.<br><br>As a result, the PC version available via Steam is very different but keeps many of the same core concepts. Additional details can be found at our subreddit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProsperityGame/comments/8pgita/difference_between_steam_version_and_web_version/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >https://www.reddit.com/r/ProsperityGame/comments/8pgita/difference_between_steam_version_and_web_version/</a></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Prosperity is a city-building resource management game. Unlock more buildings, jobs, technology, and game mechanics as you progress. Use your resources wisely, strike balance between investing and conserving. Make and maintain relationships with other towns and factions to gain access to rare resources.<br><br>Your effectiveness as a ruler is measured by a number of factors, and the further you progress in the game, the more factors you will have to consider. Which policies will you enact to reduce the amount of management needed from your part? How will you deal with crime, famine, and natural disasters?<br><br>Put your workers to work in different buildings which grow, produce, or refine materials. Over time you'll get a sense of which resources are renewable and which are not. Being able to balance progress and growing demand with the availability of resources will be crucial to the sustainability of your town.<br><br>Upgrade your buildings, learn new techs, find new trading allies, improve your standard of living, and bring Prosperity to your city.",
