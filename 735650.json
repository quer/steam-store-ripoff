But just when a new girl comes in, she brought terror to the clinic with her. Something inside the girl posseses other dying patients and try to kill you! Everything back to normal when you are not alone, so, can you survive the terror until the night crews arrives?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you at least survive for one more night?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is a clueless game which will test your gaming skills by unveiling the way to survive every night on your own. The game starts at midnight and your shift will be complete at 06.00. Your objection is, of course, to survive every night while taking care some patients, but be smart, do not forget to take care of yourself too. After all, the bad things could happen to you! Pay attention on everything, there might be some clues that can help you to survive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing:<br />\r\n- Original and complex story<br />\r\n- Clueless game that push the gamer skill to the limit<br />\r\n- 3d modelling<br />\r\n- Terrifying environment<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnity made game.",
