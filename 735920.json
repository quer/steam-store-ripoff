One of them, Koshiyama Shiki, is chosen to participate against his will in an impromptu fast-buzzing quiz meet by the president of the Quiz Bowl Circle. As a quiet boy who loves reading and doesn't want to stand out, Shiki is overwhelmed, but his classmate, Fukami Mari, is able to hit the buzzer and answer questions before the full question is given. &quot;If you buzz after you know the answer, you'll be too late. Fast buzzing can determine the winner by a margin of 0.01 seconds.&quot; As he watches her, Shiki realizes that there's a point in each question where the answer becomes certain. With fellow Quiz Bowl Circle members, Shiki meets the powerful rival Mikuriya Chisato, and experiences the joy of giving the correct answer as well as the frustration of being unable to buzz in. Koshiyama Shiki now devotes his youth to the world of competitive quiz bowl as he strives with his teammates to perfect not only his knowledge, but his technique.\r\n\r\n&quot;Don't you want to become a quiz king?!&quot;",
