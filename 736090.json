It was about a strange town, with morbid inhabitants and a horrible curse. With nothing but a few images to go by, this is what I created. 41 instrumental tracks (1 hour 50 minutes) of ugly/beautiful/surreal soundscapes and melodies. Perhaps something to take with you on a long ride through a quiet place. For fans of film scores and strange haunting ambience. I would love to know what you think of it. All contributions go towards future artistic/musical projects of mine. <br><br>Thank you for supporting my work. <br>I am truly grateful. <br>- Anadale<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">INFLUENCES: </h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>1970's/1980's Horror films <br></li><li>Akira Yamaoka (Silent Hill) <br></li><li>Nobuo Uematsu <br></li><li>David Lynch <br></li><li>Castlevania <br></li><li>Dark Souls </li></ul>",
