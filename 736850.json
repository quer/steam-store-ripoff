The Revolution has been on the outskirts of my radar for a while due to its distinct art style and an interesting concept on paper, but not much beyond said art has been seen. Now a little under a month before release, we have a look at how the gameplay is going to work. From what I've seen, it should tick a lot of my boxes.”<br><a href=\"https://www.destructoid.com/heads-roll-in-we-the-revolution-s-first-gameplay-trailer-544228.phtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br><br>“It's a gorgeous looking game and its mechanics are very pleasing, but I honestly can't remember the last time a game had quite such an oppressive atmosphere. Impressive and upsetting in equal measure, it's really stuck with me in the days since I played it and I'm still not quite sure how to feel about it - or about the choices I made during my play time.
