No invincibility frames. Not even between taking hits. If you get surrounded, you'll probably get roll'd by a bunch of pitchforks that out-ranged you. Plan your approaches appropriately.<br></li><li>A well-timed melee strike can reflect projectiles back whence they came (holding shift while doing this can redirect projectiles where the player's aiming). Some enemy projectiles can be stronger than your current arsenal, so try using their firepower against them.<br></li><li>If your weapons are doing 0 damage to an enemy, don't give up! There's still a small chance you can do some chip damage based how much their defense out-numbers your weapon's power.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Modes</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Arcade Mode</strong> (1 player): tackle a gauntlet of 4 treacheruos, procedurally-generated dungeons. Earn loot along the way and spend your gold wisely to maximize your success.<br></li><li> <strong>Target Attack</strong> (1 player): destroy a series of preconfigured targets as fast as you can with a pre-determined loadout.<br></li><li> <strong>Challenge Rooms</strong> (1 player): test your knowledge and understanding of the game's mechanics to overcome a set of dastardly scenarios, ranging from timed escape rooms to armed (and unarmed) combat challenges.<br></li><li> <strong>Horde Mode</strong> (1-4 players): team-up with up to 3 friends locally to survive waves of incoming enemies. You can revive each other as often as you want, but if everyone kicks the bucket, then its game over.</li></ul>",
