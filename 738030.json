Having been blessed with the power of holy cleansing by God, she starts fighting a modern day crusade to save the world from the communist demons that have taken over.

Monjarmageddon will remind you of classical 8 and 16 bit platformers, but at the same time it provides an automatic game save that will help you progress through the increasingly harder levels, and also provides localisation in several languages so you can enjoy the experience in your own tongue.",
