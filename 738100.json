To be able to imagine oneself in the position of becoming homeless breaks down the barrier between 'us' and 'them' and opens up possibilities for justice.”<br />\r\nSamuel Sharkey - Cinema Arts Coordinator, Exploratorium<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“I felt desperate. Unable to continue on. Thankfully the exercise ended. But I was shaken, and left with resolve to find solutions to the many whose lives are exactly like this, who aren’t living through an exercise.”<br />\r\nSteve Preminger - Special Advisor, Santa Clara County Executive<br />\r\n",
