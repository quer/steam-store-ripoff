The movie flashes-back to 1943 where a young Don Smith (Cole Carson) barely makes it to the town's Sadie Hawkins Dance, and shares one dance with his sweetheart, Corrine (Lauren Bair). Lamenting to his friend, about missing out on the entire dance, he also reveals he has been drafted into the military. Don is assigned to the 94th Infantry Division, and is immediately sent to the front lines in Europe. Serving with Don is Angelo Benedetto (Sean McGrath) a juvenile delinquent who was given the choice between jail or serving in the Army, Karl Heinrich (Brian Julian) a German Immigrant looking to prove his devotion to America, and Robert Fuller (Eric Martin Reid) who is trying to make it home to his family. The trio are just part of a much larger operation that takes them across Europe, and ultimately to Bastogne, where they play a pivotal role in the Battle of the Bulge. As the world was at the lowest Don Smith, and the men of the 94th Infantry gave the world hope again.",
