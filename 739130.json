That's the bad news. The good is that we intend to keep you in the loop about our progress and new, coolest features — mechanics, art, voiceovers, characters — on social media, with newsletters and through Steam updates. No boring stuff, promise!<br><br>Thank you for you patience and great feedback! You keep us inspired.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>The Executioner</strong> puts you in the shoes of a man who tortures people for a living while trying to retain his own sanity.<br><br>Fusing elements of a <strong>traditional RPG</strong> with <strong>investigation, exploration and moral decision-making,</strong> it invites players take on the role of a man who must seek a signed confession from those he is about to put to death.<br><br>With a predominantly text-based interface unfolding <strong>20 hours</strong> of engaging story, <strong>The Executioner</strong> promises a dark and unsettling atmosphere, and a world filled with moral ambiguity.<br><br>With the threat of revolution on the cards will you fight for monarchy and tradition or revolt in the name of progress?
