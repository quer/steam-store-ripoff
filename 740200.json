At the same time, the number of ordinary people who contracted incurable diseases grew bigger and bigger and the mercury treatment no longer helped them. Soon it became clear that being around «mercuries», that’s how people who passed the transfusion were called, is dangerous. As a result, the world government introduced a complete ban on mercury operations, special police units of hunters were created, who sought out and eliminated mercury people.

Since the inner zone was organized by the politicians themselves and not policemen, it was heavily guarded against any intrusion attempts, and it was possible to get there only for a huge amount of money after passing the loyalty test. If less than a month had passed since the transfusion, mercuries were sent to the outer zone. If more than a month had passed, then mercuries were accused of concealing their status and were liquidated.
