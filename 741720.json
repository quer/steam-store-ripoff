But the experiment got out of control and all of the experimental have turned into zombies as a result. During short period of time almost all residential sectors of the station have become infected. Your goal is to prevent further spread of infection in the remaining unaffected sectors. To achieve this goal you are provided with ultra-modern military turrets. Exterminate the horde of infected ones as they break into the residential sectors. And save the last sane crew`s members, there are only 25 left… <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSector 177 is a game in the genre of Tower Defense <br />\r\nThe rules of the game are quite simple: there are modules on the playing field, on which turrets are build. You can buy them in the store. You get money for buying turrets by killing the infected ones.<br />\r\nThere are 10 waves in the game, the reward for killing the infected ones are getting higher with every wave, but the infected ones also become more and more aggressive with every new wave and it becomes more difficult to stop them. Therefore, your goal is to distribute your money correctly while buying turrets, so you can hold out during all 10 waves and keep the infected ones away from the residential sectors.",
