With the ability to fly and to morph into items, your mission is either to seek and kill your opponents or to search for keys and escape the level.<br><br>Powerful items are randomly scattered throughout the level and will help you reach your goal.

The team and map sizes adjust to the number of players. <br><br>• <strong>randomly scattered items</strong> – Each game will be different.  Most items have a small chance to be of a legendary grade.<br><br>• <strong>polymorph</strong> – The players can morph themselves into common items like chairs, cans, plates, (...) to hide. Every collected item of this type will prolong the time of the polymorph.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/741980/extras/ezgif.com-crop_(1).png?t=1509888617\" ><br><br>• <strong>sound</strong> – Bernackels' Shoggoth is heavily dependant on sound. If you move too fast, the environment will reveal your position. <br><br>• <strong>clues</strong> – Any serious impact lets your dragon shriek and bleed.  Changes to the state of the environment (blood, opened doors, switched lights, misplaced items...) may reveal a player's position. <br><br>• <strong>flying</strong> – The flying system is easy to understand, but hard to master. With the right angle and timing, you might get an advantage over your enemy.<br><br>• <strong>stealth</strong>  – Hiding and sneaking are essential gameplay mechanics. The chances to flee successfully from a hunter are slim. <br><br>• <strong>physics</strong> – Almost every item is physically simulated and replicated throughout the network. ",
