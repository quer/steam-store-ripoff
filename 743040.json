With a lot of help from engineers and compression specialists at <strong>Pixvana's SPIN Studio</strong>, we were able to push the quality of stereoscopic (3D) 360° streaming video beyond what was previously believed possible. <br><br>With the January 2018 update, we're happy to introduce new encodings of <i>The Pull</i>, featuring brand new <strong>highest bitrate settings</strong> and optimizations to all streaming quality tiers. <br><br>Enjoy!</p><br><h1>About the Video</h1><i>Gravity is no longer a constant.<br>Enter a world where the rules that bind us<br>are suddenly disobeyed.</i><br><br>In a secret science facility, gravity has been conquered. “Down” is no longer a direction, but a choice. Step into the center of modified chambers and witness the laws of nature be broken in this five-experiment series.<br><br>VR has all but torn down the barriers between the imagination of the creator and the experience of the viewer. A concept like The Pull simply does not translate into traditional 2D. We can suggest concepts through TVs and monitors, but we can’t truly experience them — and breaking the very laws of nature is something that can only be experienced.<br><br>While flat media limits us to hinting and coaxing at an experience, by creating in VR, I can more faithfully share my vision with you, the viewer. For a few minutes – for five chambers – I can truly invite you into my world.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong><br>For the sake of full disclosure - yes, you can find this film legally and for free elsewhere on the Internet. Purchasing it on Steam will help show your appreciation of QubaVR's work on this funded-out-of-pocket art project.",
