It will be useful for newbies, as well as for experienced players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">5 Minion caches</h2><br>It’s dangerous to go alone, especially if you are new to this world. That's why we prepared several caches with minions for you. There are plenty of summoned creatures with various skills in Arinar, but no one knows for sure what caches conceal. Your goal is to catch 'em all! Just kidding, no need to catch them. Just open a cache and receive a temporary companion helping you in fighting enemies.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Elixir of Knowledge</h2><br>A priceless item that helps gaining more experience for completing quests and leveling up faster. Just don't forget that elixir's duration is limited, so use it wisely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Extra pocket</h2><br>Each traveler needs a capacious bag. More capacious. And even more capacious. This pocket provides additional place for trophies, and we hope that it won't stay empty.<br><br>Attention! This gift will be sent to your account as soon as this DLC is added to your Steam library. To receive it, choose a character that you want to claim the gift with, open the mailbox (Menu-Character-Mailbox), choose a letter and press &quot;To bag&quot;.  Notice that the gift may be activated only by one character on each account.",
