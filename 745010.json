Gather resources, kill monsters, acquire new technologies and use your imagination and wit to build crazy mechanical devices to conquer any challenges in your way.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745010/extras/Steam-powered_machines.png?t=1533810723\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745010/extras/Machines.jpg?t=1533810723\" ><br>In Mechanic Miner you can construct any kind of machine of your own design - and any kind of machine can be simulated by the game's physics engine - and of course, designs can be shared with your friends through Steam Workshop. Build a catapult, a submarine, a battle tank or a air balloon - Mechanic Miner has over 50 different parts and building blocks for you to play around with, and we’re constantly adding more. Get creative, get better, build more advanced stuff and become a mechanical mastermind to conquer any challenges that may lie ahead.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745010/extras/Storymode.png?t=1533810723\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745010/extras/Idle.jpg?t=1533810723\" ><br>In story mode you’re stranded on a strange and forbidding planet, where survival is made difficult by hostile animals and plant life. From your home world you did bring a multitool, which is able to craft any kind of machine part - provided the requisite raw materials can be found. Relying solely on the technology you brought, you set out to explore a whole world. <br>But the road isn't paved with ease. You will face bosses, waves of monsters and the harsh obstacles offered by the environment surrounding you will show no mercy. To survive and advance the storyline you must acquire the necessary steam-powered technology, that will allow you to delve deeper into the diverse biomes of the planet, and perhaps, ultimately, discover the means to escape.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745010/extras/Creativemode.png?t=1533810723\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745010/extras/Buildingv3.jpg?t=1533810723\" ><br>In creative mode you can let out your inner mechanic shine.
