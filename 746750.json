It presents a world captured by the united forces of demons and monsters. The Werewolf King, the Great Old One, Satan, the Great Voodoo Shaman and Dracula join forces to eradicate love and bring eternal darkness to the world, and perhaps to also drink lots of tea and discuss art. The only one with a chance of stopping them is our amnesiac exorcist. At the request of the Pope himself he sets off on the quest to fight for good and justice, leaving behind a trail of cigarette butts and empty whiskey bottles.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/746750/extras/Story.png?t=1545853252\" ><br><br>A retired exorcist is forced to don his cassock one last time to save the world. Lying on a bed in a dingy hotel, the exorcist was unaware that his one night stand beauty would become a threat… Just after midnight she revealed her demonic face and perfectly sharp, though very unwomanly, claws. As it turned out later, this case wasn’t the last. A sect of the most powerful and the most iconic bad guys of pop culture threatens the world. Only our hero can stop them with the help of his lackluster faith. Will his dusty Bible, revolver and a wooden stake be enough? Will the exorcist recover his lost memories and regain his abilities?<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/746750/extras/Features.png?t=1545853252\" ><br><br>* Storyline inspired by popular themes from movies and comic books like &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;Constantine&quot;, with a humorous twist<br>* Comic-style graphics<br>* Unique fight system, both turn-based and live-action, by performing an exorcism<br>* The only adventure where you can call the Pope and ask for help",
