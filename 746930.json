It features everything you love about an MMO: a huge open world, dozens of hours of quests following an intriguing story, interesting lore and characters, dragon pets, five-player group dungeons, world bosses, voice chat, player trading, fishing and crafting, and more! Plus you'll be part of a world brimming with thousands of other players.<br><br>Although this is an indie MMO project, we have spent the last year building a community around the game and holding Alpha and Beta tests in which thousands of players have participated. We're now ready to release the game into Early Access on Steam (with support for both SteamVR and Oculus Rift). Although the game isn't final, there will be no further character wipes once Early Access begins. And there's already so much to do, including:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> 20+ hours of Main Story and side quests as you embark on an adventure to advance your character from Level 1 to 20.<br></li><li> 4 major five-person dungeons, each with unique enemies and bosses with interesting mechanics<br></li><li> 9 overworld zones spanning more than 10 square kilometers, including the high-level Wilds zones where danger lurks around every corner and open world PvP can happen<br></li><li> 4 different and unique classes to play including the Ranger, Musketeer, Warrior, and Runemage<br></li><li> 2 crafting classes: Alchemy and Artificing, plus Fishing<br></li><li> In-game voice chat, dungeon finder, fellowships, private messaging, and other socialization features to keep you connected to the world<br></li><li> Dedicated, collaborative development process with an indie dev team that cares about your feedback<br></li><li> Dragon pets, cosmetic capes, achievements, and much more!</li></ul><br>Funded by a successful Kickstarter campaign early last year, we've assembled an amazing team that has worked tirelessly along with our community to shape this game into something truly special. This is not a game that barely functions or a tech demo -- this is truly an immersive, vast world that you can jump into and begin to explore and conquer along with a thousand other VR MMO enthusiasts! <br><br>However, please do note that the game is in an <strong>Early Access State</strong>. We are beyond &quot;Beta&quot; but not yet at a point where we consider the game polished enough for a full release. There are still bugs, things are still being worked on, and new features are still being added. But if you want to join now and help us build something new that's never been done in VR before -- come join us today!<br><br><strong>Buy Once, Play Forever</strong><br>OrbusVR does not have a required monthly subscription fee! Once you've bought the game, you are able to play it as much as you'd like without paying us another dime. We don't have any &quot;Pay 2 Win&quot; in-app purchases or loot boxes, either. In the future, we may introduce an in-game cosmetics shop, but anything purchased there will not have any game mechanic advantages. <br><br>Our ongoing business strategy is to release yearly expansion packs which will cost an additional fee to unlock that new content, similar to other &quot;Buy Once&quot; MMOs.<br><br><strong>Solo Play</strong><br>There's plenty to do on your own in OrbusVR. The main story quest alone provides more than 20 hours of content for you to enjoy, as you learn about the new realm and its inhabitants. While you're doing that, seek out the Explorer's League and aid them in uncovering the long-lost secrets of the world. And of course you can attempt to make your way as a Merchant, crafting and acquiring valuable items to offer for sale at your market stall, or via player trading.<br><br><strong>Group Content</strong><br>While you can go it alone some of the time, eventually you'll need a group to accomplish some of the most daring feats available. Delve dungeons to defeat the monsters that lurk there, which will require skill and coordination in your group. Take on huge world bosses that require a dozen fellow heroes if you're going to have a chance at defeating them. Or pull up a chair and socialize at the Lakewood Inn, regaling other adventurers with your tales.<br><br>Future expansions will unlock raids, our most challenging content designed for a group of players to tackle.<br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>The combat of OrbusVR has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of room-scale VR. That means instead of just mashing buttons on an ability bar, you actually have to hone your physical skill to become more effective at combat.<br><br>For example, there's no tab-targetting for Rangers, who have to actually aim and hit targets with their bow. And for the Runemage, your ablity to cast spells is determined by how quickly and precisely you can draw the ancient symbols of runespeak. Whether you're looking for an up-close-and-personal, physically demanding melee role, or a more planned-out approach to combat via the musketeer's orbs, you'll find that combat in OrbusVR is unlike any other MMO you've ever played.<br><br><strong>Relax</strong><br>When you're ready to put down your sword for the day, you've got some great options available to kick back and relax. Fishing is a great way to pass the time and earn a little dram while you're at it. Just pull up a chair and see what fish are biting at Kingsport Lake. Maybe you'll break your record?<br><br>When you finish with that, you can enjoy your own personal Player House, where you can craft potions and age them in your cellar, patiently waiting for the right moment to use (or sell) them. Finally, be sure to spend some time enjoying the company of your pet dragon, who's always interested in what treats you might have for them to munch on.<br><br><strong>VR Support From the Beginning</strong><br><br>OrbusVR has been designed from the ground-up for desktop VR systems. As such we have full support for 180-degree (front facing) and 360-degree tracking setups.
