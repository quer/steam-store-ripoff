They are colourful, smart and small.<br><br>One day six Titians - Grutius, Bobotius, Lili, Ned, Goratius and Maca are playing together when a mysterious object appears in the sky.

He has the personality traits of a boss and can be authoritarian sometimes. He tends to be defensive and doesn’t trust easily, often reacting to a situation with a negative outlook. He will need to learn to be more optimistic, acquire a positive mind in order to build a more positive future. He also needs to learn to be more patient and more trusting of people and his friends.<br><br>Grutius believes that being optimistic is a waste of time and prefers to think negatively in order to avoid disappointments. He can also be lazy and believes that work is too hard; you will often find him sitting around while the others work.<br><br>Grutius can be proud and sometimes unfriendly but if you treat him well, he can become docile and even shy sometimes, especially around Lili. He can lack self-esteem and is in need of love and affection.<br><br>His loyal friend is Rox the balloon. Rox has an enquiring mind and is eager to learn. He likes to investigate and asks lots of questions. He is keen to find out how they mysteriously arrived on Planet Earth, but his curiosity doesn’t end there, he also wants to find out more about the meaning of life and the universe.

He believes that we were all made from the coming together of small particles of energy after the universe was created. He will share his beliefs with Lili and his friends to create a galaxy transporter in the hope they can get back to Titius and tell their parents all about the great adventures they had on planet Earth. Ned will be the one who tells his friends all about new technologies and he will be the first one to take a flight to discover another continent.<br><br><br><strong>Goratius and Maca</strong><br>Aspect: Gorilla Height: Very Big<br>Temperament: Rude<br><br>Goratius and Maca are bound together by a belt; they are inseparable and can’t live without each other.

In the story they will start to feel guilty about their behavior and try to improve themselves and become better friends. When they are mean, their colour is dark and when they are good their colour is bright. Maca looks like a bat.<br><br>Before the story ends they will eventually learn that being good is better than being bad.
