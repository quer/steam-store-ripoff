Have fun on the couch with your friends and kick back and have some fun with some good old boxing competition. If no friends are available, have fun in the single player or our endless challenge mode! There is much to enjoy for everyone in the boxing ring. Full controller and keyboard support are present and both allow for easy control of your fighter.<br><br>Impartial Studios is a one man operation ran by a second year college student named Jake Olson. Hence the name, “Olson’s Boxing Challenge”. The game has a lot of value for the one dollar that it costs and I promise you’ll get a lot of bang for your buck! Continued support is planned to come to Olson’s boxing challenge in the form of new game modes in the future! I’m always looking for positive and negative feedback in order to make the product better.
