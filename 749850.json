Thus begins our heroine’s journey through the labyrinth known as “The Tree of Time”.<br><br><br>If Rose is defeated during the adventure, she will lose all items and her level will be reset.

Your courage and growth as an adventurer will be the keys to this quest!<br><br><br><strong>Every decision holds a victory!</strong><br><br>This is a turn-based game. <br><br>Rose and her enemies move in turns, giving you ample time to ponder your next action. It is wisdom and courage which will bring small victories here, ultimately leading you on the path to great triumph.<br><br><br><strong>The &quot;Fang&quot; system:</strong><br><br>Rose can equip the Fangs of defeated monsters, gaining their abilities in the process. <br><br>There are more than 200 types of monster! <br><br>Fangs can be combined however you like: search for powerful combinations or just use those of your favourite monster. The possibilities are endless and each choice leads to a different adventure.<br><br><br><strong>The &quot;Brave&quot; system:</strong><br><br>Unlike most rogue-likes where strategic use of corridors is rewarded, fighting in the open is key here! When the 8 spaces adjacent to Rose are obstacle-free, her attacks are more powerful!
