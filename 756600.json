Fight against Dozen of Enemies, Dodging thousands of Bullet while facing off Giant Robot, all At-The-Same-Time! Your Class may be your Fate, your Actions and Skills may change your Destiny, yet your Tactic will shape your Path to Victory!</h2><br><br>Battle Splash tells a story about Trianga Polyga, who created a Virtual/Augmented Reality system that could simulate real-life experience/environment in an enclosed area, called &quot;Brainwave Oriented Simulation System (or B.O.S.s)&quot;. She then wrote &quot;Battle Splash&quot;, a game inside B.O.S.s that features high speed Water Balloons and Water simulation in order to create the most intense Squirt Gun Battle ever. She then invited her friend (Temiko Kangara), her cousin (Pentaga Polyga) and her sister (Quadra Polyga) to test the game out. After an unexpected journey due to a bug during the test, she then further improved the game, and made the second version of it: &quot;Battle Splash 2.0&quot;.<br><br>The game is designed to be as Easy to Play as possible, while still keeps the best features of Classic Arena Shooter and Class-based Shooter. Battle Splash's gameplay heavily relies on Water Splash Mechanic, which changes the shape of the Splash Explosion depending on the surrounding area. In addition, the game is fully Physics-based, leading to Ballistic Bullets, Bouncing Balloons and lots of Physics features, thus feel free to perform some &quot;Redefined&quot; old tricks from Arena Shooter such as Bullet Dodging, Rocket Jump or Balloons Hop.<br><br>For even more diversity in gameplay, player can take control of the 4 playable Characters, which represent 4 different Classes in the game. Each character has their own Stats and Abilities that when combined with each Weapon they can further improve their performance or change their role in battle in real-time.
