There are two noteworthy bugs. first, because the full game is not out, you may get a &quot;can't install&quot; error, when trying to play the demo. Just keep on pressing &quot;yes&quot; and the demo will override and install. This is a Steam bug, as Steam is not really made for demos being out a year in advance of the game.<br><br>Second, you can't yet play the demo on laptops. I'll have this feature ready by Christmas, but right now the resolution scaling is not implemented for monitors smaller than 1920px.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>An interactive fiction adventure-strategy parody. Send agents on missions, build your base, research occult superweapons and buy units. Along the way, unlock occult mysteries. Plus romance Kelly from Mass Effect. You play the demo now for free.<br><br>The demo is very much in an alpha state. After feedback both good and bad, the game is being substantially improved and the new demo will release later this year. I appreciate if you wish to try the game out. However, it currently has a confusing plotline and game mechanics that are being worked on.<br><br>This is a screenshot from the beta, due out September 2018:<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/757220/extras/vetsteam.jpg?t=1529837205\" >",
