Join powerful cults to gain new perks and powers. You can even worship some beings in secret without violating existing pacts, if you don't get caught.<br><br>Shadowcrawl is less about luck or collecting loot than it is about strategy. As you accumulate perks and abilities your character will take on traits that let them adapt more effectively to different features of the maze generator, forcing you to think strategically at all times about where you are standing and where you are going. <br><br>Most players know many moves ahead of time if they are going to die once they learn how to read the battlefield.
