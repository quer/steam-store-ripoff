Gifted with extraordinary physical, mental and military prowess, the globe-spanning squirrel empire is the envy of the world … and the focus of its fears.  An uneasy peace between unequal species has endured for decades, but change can come swiftly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA PHYSICS-DRIVEN WORLD<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe island od Skyline and its surroundings are your sandbox to live in and play with, testing almost endless strategies and approaches to situations.

Every problem  in the game world can be approached in the same way that you might approach it in real life with your own body.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nREALISTIC OBJECT HANDLING AND WEIGHT PHYSICS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPick up, carry and drop objects with your player character's hands, using one hand or both.  Every object has a mass that affects mobility, enabling flexible balancing of held objects for different character builds (lightly equipped and vulnerable but fast moving, heavily equippe and well protected but slow, etc).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nObject mass also realistically influences the movement speed of the limbs and body, with quick arm swinging of lightweight objects and slow swinging when holding heavy objects.  Movement actions such as walking / running, jumping and side-stepping are also altered by the total carried mass.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFLESH SENSITIVITY<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach part of the player character's body has impact-sensitive flesh that can determine the strength of impacts applied ot it and generate the appropriate level of pain response.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSevere pain reduces the effectiveness of that body part, enabling enemies or opposition players to deliberately target and wear down those part.  The injured player, meanwhile, has the opportunity to counter with other body sections until the pain in the affected parts has subsided, restoring their full function.  The intensity of physical pain and emotional states is also reflected in the facial expressions of characters, providing visual feedback to friend and foe alike. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCREATE YOUR OWN CHARACTER<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreate and name your own custom squirrel character from a wide range of personalization options.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOFFLINE SINGLEPLAYER AND MULTIPLAYER<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay solo or with up to three players on the same computer in split-screen view.  Work together in co-op or duel each other for honors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nONLINE MULTIPLAYER<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo online on your own or with a team of up to eight players on your computer and host an online server or join a server.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe number of players that can be hosted in an online session or join an existing session as clients is dictated by the specification of the host and client computers.",
