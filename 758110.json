            "detailed_description": "Here was an isolated mountain village named Monobeno. The village here had a certain rustic charm and kept faith with the coexistence of humans and monsters. Our story began here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe protagonist, Tooru Sawai, was born and grew up here. He and his sister, Natsuha Sawai, depended on each other. While she had lost some of her memories by accident…<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt had been a few years since Tooru Sawai moved away, he set foot again in this beautiful and magical land full of adventures and legends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApart from the age-old Tang Umbrella Monster Hisyakaku, he was reunited with two young girls: his childhood sweetheart, Alice Arisma, and Red Bear Monster, Sumi. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen there was a mask dancing at the summer festival, Natsuha Sawai fell down and suddenly grew up. Only through one night long, her body turned to an adult size. She was tortured by this abnormal growing, both physically and mentally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was caused by disease or monsters’ haunting?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBetween medicine and legends, Tooru Sawai tried to find a way to save his sister. With the help of Alice or Sumi’s power, what kind of romantic story would happen during their adventures? And was there something happened more than brother and sister?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis was a story about humans and monsters, diseases and monsters’ haunting, and the past and the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a dedicated art created by Lose— a new star of Japanese visual novel companies. It has ample CGs, magnificent performances, extraordinary music and voice acting, which leads you to the unusual traditional Japanese culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is going to be divided into two titles for sale. The prequel is 『Monobeno』 Main Story, and the sequel is『Monobeno』 After Story which is going to be released as a DLC.",
