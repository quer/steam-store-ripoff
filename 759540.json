Being video game enthusiasts ourselves, we’d like to invite you to join us on this endeavor – share your thoughts and suggestions with us and let us together shape this amazing VR experience.<br><br>The core of Wanted Killer VR is an innovative movement system called “Tactical Teleport”, which lets you maneuver towards a specific location in bullet-time while all enemies (and their bullets) move in slow-motion. The clue is that teleportation can only be used on enemies momentarily after killing them – this allows for coping with even the most intense situations and a beautiful mix of action and strategy, which we consider the secret sauce of Wanted Killer VR’s gunplay.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/759540/extras/bullet-time.jpg?t=1550164527\" ><br><br>In Wanted Killer VR, you play as dual pistol expert Ricky, allrounder Mia, shotgun brawler Teo or master sharpshooter Aya. As you progress through the single player campaign, skill challenges, or wave-based survival mode, a unique brand of teleport system lets you experience player-driven bullet-time-shooting with a twist. Paired with a flow-based combo system that invites you to take out enemies in style, Wanted Killer VR allows for unparalleled strategic combat as you dash between opponents and complete diverse challenges in spectacular settings – including skyscrapers in the clouds, a mysterious genetics lab, and an ever-changing subway station.<br><br>Create your very own action sequence and chain together kills using a variety of weapon types – pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers, sniper rifles… they’re all yours! Created to offer visually stunning one-of-a-kind gunplay, you can expect innovative weapons and fluid controls when you unleash vengeance against challenging enemies in diverse and beautiful levels.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/759540/extras/shoot_air.jpg?t=1550164527\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2>Wanted Killer VR is a frenzied first-person shooter that puts you in charge of the WK4: a trigger-happy squad of mercenaries on a mission.
