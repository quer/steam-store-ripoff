As a contender in this dark future’s most popular blood sport, you must battle the most dangerous motorized killers from around the world to the beats of an immersive synthwave soundtrack. You are a battle-hardened gladiator, your ride is your weapon, and your fame can mean the difference between death or glory.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>NO GAME IS THE SAME</strong></h2><br>Fight in a variety of arenas against a host of different enemies. Each wave spawns varying enemies and therefore a different challenge every time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GO BIG OR GO HOME</strong></h2><br>Simply surviving is not good enough. What you do and how you do it is reflected in your popularity. Please the sociopathic crowds with an exciting, explosive show and you can expect prizes and buffs. Provide a dull performance and you are in for a nasty surprise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ADAPT OR DIE</strong></h2><br>Enemy fire is not the only danger present in the arena. Emergent environmental threats such as cybersandworms, laser walls, and incinerators, just to name a few, create additional hazards… but you can always use them to your advantage.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>YOU LIVE, YOU DIE, YOU FIGHT AGAIN</strong></h2><br>There are only a handful of MEGADOME champions, so you are expected to die. A lot! While death means the end of the current playthrough, you still keep the fame points you have gained to upgrade your driver and your ride… Become an ever more menacing MEGADOME contender.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/760050/extras/steam.jpg?t=1546263277\" >",
