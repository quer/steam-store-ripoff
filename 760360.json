With each passed level the game is integrated into a complex puzzle, which demonstrates the various functions and variables within scripts. <br>The gameplay encourages interaction, exploration, teaches a method of trial and error. A good game leaves the player with time to develop his skills, the same thing happens in the learning process. Naturally, to understand the scripts you'll need to explore the library of functions. Through these actions the player will learn new tools and discover his own abilities to programming. The very visual programming does not require the initial preparation for the game, the quests themselves teach a player, allowing him to understand the basic principles of programming. All that is required for the player is logic, which helps training and completing levels.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/760360/extras/Sandbox.png?t=1528213018\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/760360/extras/Line.png?t=1528213018\" ><br>In the game there is also a sandbox, you can use it for implementation of your different ideas, or just for practice or study.
