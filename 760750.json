The aim of the game is to choose an initial state and observe how it evolves. Different sizes for the map and trully infinite posibilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are four rules that determine the movements:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.<br />\r\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.<br />\r\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.<br />\r\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat to expect:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Simulation of one of the most simple and amazing games ever created.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Original soundtrack during gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Different sizes with up to 10000 cells.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Easy interface and easy to understand gameplay.",
