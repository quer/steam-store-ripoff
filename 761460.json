When you play it you won’t feel like the game’s pushing you to a specific solution, it’s up to you to decide what trails to follow and who to accuse. And if you fail then you fail. More games should have this approach.”<br>100 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://cliqist.com/2018/09/14/lamplight-city-review-victorian-steampunk-noir/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Cliqist</a><br><br>“A great detective game, it's not for the faint-hearted. Well-written and with multiple character paths to choose from, Lamplight City isn't for puzzle seekers but will satisfy those looking for a great mystery.”<br>95 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://techraptor.net/content/lamplight-city-review?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >TechRaptor</a><br><br>“After the delights of sci-fi adventure Shardlight we were always going to be interested in what Francisco Gonzalez did next.
