            "detailed_description": "The demo version of Willowisp VR contains a single level that gradually introduces the game mechanics from the first 4 levels of the full game, including: striking wisps with color matching swords, physically dodging bombs, using mirrors to see wisps attacking from behind.  The demo level is relatively low difficulty and ends when the player reaches the target score.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe full version of Willowisp VR includes additional mechanics, including: tracker wisps that cannot be dodged, purple wisps that must be hit with both swords, and armored enemies that can only be hit where they are vulnerable.  These game mechanics are fully explored in the game's 10-part Story Mode, which ends with a boss fight where a giant wisp that must be hit many times moves slowly towards you, setting the island on fire as it pushes you back.  In addition, the full version also includes an open-ended Survival challenge where you can compete for a top score on the Leaderboards.",
