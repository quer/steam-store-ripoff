It can take you from the year 1804 to the year 2000. It can take you from penniless manual laborer to powerful multi-millionaire.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt can take you from a normal, well-adjusted, well-rounded person to an obsessed, singled-minded, one-tracked train head. This is a real railroad game, not just a strategy game that happens to involve railroads. If you want to hop on a plane, car or ship, hop on another game.<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is about trains for people who love trains. Everything about the game is centered around an authentic look and feeling of the railways. Period video and pictures are interlaced with the game. The design and interface are true to the character of the fabled late 1800's railroads. A.I. opponents are based on real people. And all maps are real (based on satellite photography from US Geological Service and other sources).",
