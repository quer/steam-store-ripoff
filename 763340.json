            "detailed_description": "<h1>Developer's Note</h1><p>This is the desktop version of my push-your-luck card game Brave Hand. Please expect Brave Hand to be a small, replayable, solitaire-like card game where your goal is to beat your previous score, and unlock a light story along the way. I made it because I loved the simple yet replayable games that came with my first computer, and wanted something like them, but with just a little more strategy. If the main &quot;Brave&quot; mode is too hard or too random for your taste, be sure to try out the other modes! Each mode is designed to cater to a specific type of playstyle. Please contact me through Twitter, our forums, or my website if you run into any trouble or just want to follow along with development. I really hope you enjoy the game. <i>-Scott Brodie</i></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>You’ve landed on a mysterious island and unearthed a long forgotten card game. As you play, you begin to unravel clues to its origin, strategy, and hidden powers. Are you brave enough to push on and discover all of its secrets?<br><br>Brave Hand is an original single-player card game about pushing your luck. Beautifully simple yet deeply strategic. As you play, you unlock the story of the Wanderer and the Guardian, depicted across 16 gorgeous hand-painted themes. An elegant design that combines the simplicity of classic card games like Solitaire and War, and the strategy of collectible card games.<br><br>Brave Hand was inspired by the desire for a more strategic and exciting single player card game. The game takes the play style of solitaire, and enhance it with more competition, tension, and strategic decision making. It’s an endlessly fun game that will keep you guessing for years to come.",
