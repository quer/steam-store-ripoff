To make ends meet she works as a caterer and, as the film opens, is left to tend to the post-funeral gathering for Hank Boyd, a quiet loner who stood accused of a horrific crime and took his own life before standing trial. Sarah knew Hank in high school and, while he was a strange kid, doesn’t believe that he could do something so terrible. Her suspicions grow stronger after she meets Hank’s brother David, a local cop with a checkered past, his dimwitted partner Ray who’s charged with guarding the house, David’s mother Beverly who’s in the latter stages of dementia and Aubrey, his distant and obviously damaged younger sister. When Sarah overhears David and Ray talking her suspicions turn to alarm as it’s implied they were somehow complicit in Hank’s death and may have plans for her as well. Meanwhile Beverly has become convinced that Sarah is her long lost daughter while Aubrey pines for the affections of her big brother when she’s not trying to ruin him. As the family is exposed and the bodies pile up, Sarah must give the performance of a lifetime if she hopes to survive, and all because… HANK BOYD IS DEAD",
