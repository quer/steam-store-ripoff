The helmet of your squad leader will always be yellow, and helmets of squad members will be beige.<br><br><strong>Game Mode</strong><br><br>Each team starts with a number of tickets defined by the server and map. The map contains a number of spawn points, the team in control of the least amount of spawn points will continuously lose tickets at a rate consistent with the difference in spawn points between the teams. If teams control an equal amount of spawn points they will both lose one ticket per time interval. When a team member is killed, a ticket is lost for that team. When a team has zero tickets it has lost the game.<br><br><strong>Infantry</strong> (Any player not in a vehicle)<br><br>Infantry can walk, sprint, crouch and hover/fly. <br>Hovering can be done continuously for a few seconds, energy must afterwards be regenerated by not hovering for a period of time.<br>Crouching increases the current maximum view-distance and greatly reduces recoil, if the extra view-distance is used the image will become slightly zoomed in.<br>Some weapons such as deployed sniper rifle and machine gun will greatly reduce the movement speed of the player.<br>Some weapons like anti-tank missiles will fire with extreme inaccuracy if used while sprinting or moving.<br>Infantry and vehicles are able to slowly dig themselves through sand without using weapons.<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong><br><br>Weapons have a recoil and a spread. The spread is affected by weapon stats, movement of the player and how continuously the weapon is fired. Firing in short bursts will cause less spread than continuous firing.<br>Weapons used as infantry have recoil that will more or less push the crosshair upwards depending on weapon stats and player movement. The crosshair will not automatically re-position itself, this is up to the player to do.<br>Each weapon has a limited maximum view-distance.<br><br><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br><br>Using mouse and keyboard as input devices is recommended, but it is possible to use game controllers that use Xinput (Xbox 360 controllers). It is possible to configure controller stick sensitivity and keyboard bindings but not the key bindings of a handcontroller.<br><br>Playing a game with 64 active players as a client will require approximately 400kbit/s download and 8kbit/s upload speed. <br>Hosting a game with 64 active human players will in theory require approximately 512kbit/s download and 25Mbit/s upload speed.<br><br><strong>Hosting a public online game requires port forwarding of TCP port 17113 and UDP port 17112 if behind a router!</strong><br><br>Every game is hosted in a separate server process, even playing against bots locally in a non-public game will start a server process. This is started automatically when hosting a game from the in-game menus. If you started a server process, it is stopped automatically when leaving the game. The server runs with a command line interface and can be interacted with by simply alt-tabbing to it in windows. The CLI can be used to alter game values such as number of bots and tickets, instantly run the next map, restart the current map, ban specific players and so on.<br><br>The game was built with organic, home-grown c++ code and open source libraries.<br><br>Epileptic warning: This game contains flashing images",

If this occurs the vehicle will have a reduced movement speed depending on the ratio of lost to maximum number of wheels. If the remaining wheels are not balanced the vehicle will remain tilted to a certain angle. If all wheels are lost the vehicle will instantly be destroyed. Wheels have low armor and can thus be damaged by non-armor-piercing blasts or bullets.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/765010/extras/tracked.png?t=1545576568\" ><br>Vehicles may lose wheels, causing reduced speed and a permanent tilt.<br><br><strong>Squads</strong><br><br>A team is composed of a number of squads.

The helmet of your squad leader will always be yellow, and helmets of squad members will be beige.<br><br><strong>Game Mode</strong><br><br>Each team starts with a number of tickets defined by the server and map. The map contains a number of spawn points, the team in control of the least amount of spawn points will continuously lose tickets at a rate consistent with the difference in spawn points between the teams. If teams control an equal amount of spawn points they will both lose one ticket per time interval. When a team member is killed, a ticket is lost for that team. When a team has zero tickets it has lost the game.<br><br><strong>Infantry</strong> (Any player not in a vehicle)<br><br>Infantry can walk, sprint, crouch and hover/fly. <br>Hovering can be done continuously for a few seconds, energy must afterwards be regenerated by not hovering for a period of time.<br>Crouching increases the current maximum view-distance and greatly reduces recoil, if the extra view-distance is used the image will become slightly zoomed in.<br>Some weapons such as deployed sniper rifle and machine gun will greatly reduce the movement speed of the player.<br>Some weapons like anti-tank missiles will fire with extreme inaccuracy if used while sprinting or moving.<br>Infantry and vehicles are able to slowly dig themselves through sand without using weapons.<br><br><strong>Weapons</strong><br><br>Weapons have a recoil and a spread. The spread is affected by weapon stats, movement of the player and how continuously the weapon is fired. Firing in short bursts will cause less spread than continuous firing.<br>Weapons used as infantry have recoil that will more or less push the crosshair upwards depending on weapon stats and player movement. The crosshair will not automatically re-position itself, this is up to the player to do.<br>Each weapon has a limited maximum view-distance.<br><br><strong>Miscellaneous</strong><br><br>Using mouse and keyboard as input devices is recommended, but it is possible to use game controllers that use Xinput (Xbox 360 controllers). It is possible to configure controller stick sensitivity and keyboard bindings but not the key bindings of a handcontroller.<br><br>Playing a game with 64 active players as a client will require approximately 400kbit/s download and 8kbit/s upload speed. <br>Hosting a game with 64 active human players will in theory require approximately 512kbit/s download and 25Mbit/s upload speed.<br><br><strong>Hosting a public online game requires port forwarding of TCP port 17113 and UDP port 17112 if behind a router!</strong><br><br>Every game is hosted in a separate server process, even playing against bots locally in a non-public game will start a server process. This is started automatically when hosting a game from the in-game menus. If you started a server process, it is stopped automatically when leaving the game. The server runs with a command line interface and can be interacted with by simply alt-tabbing to it in windows. The CLI can be used to alter game values such as number of bots and tickets, instantly run the next map, restart the current map, ban specific players and so on.<br><br>The game was built with organic, home-grown c++ code and open source libraries.<br><br>Epileptic warning: This game contains flashing images",
