Collecting and capsuling the essence (life source) which is scattered around the world. After that, say hello to the new colonists. Our hero has to protect these new colonists by building a home for them. As time goes by, customize and extend the base and improve the colonists’ surviving abilities, produce essences and increase the number of colonists. This is your reign, colonists do everything that you say. You can assign them to the turrets and capsules which are used for producing essence, or keep them as a companion of yours.

There is a vast open world waiting for you; explore the mysterious areas and caves, and hunt down the enemy bases. Colonists are awaiting you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Collect Life Resources</h2>Gather essence from mysterious caves or by eliminating your dangerous enemies. You can use the essence for regenerating health or creating new colonists!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Capture Enemy Settlements</h2>Discover life capsules scattered all over the world and start creating new colonists!
