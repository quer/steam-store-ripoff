Super massive black holes to view such as the Sagittarius A*.<br><br> <strong> Custom Solar Systems and Planetary Collisions</strong><br><br> Create your own Solar Systems by adding/removing planets.  Edit properties such as the planet orbit radius, direction and speed. You can even scale planets and objects to your liking. Do you want to create an Earth larger than our sun? Go for it! Launch massive planetary bodies and asteroids to view planetary collisions on an astronomical level. Hurl planets and everyday objects and watch gravitational physics in action.<br><br><strong> Create and Terraform Planets</strong><br><br> Melt polar caps by increasing the temperature or freeze the planet entirely. Add vegetation, clouds, water and planetary rings with its own asteroid belt. Increase the population of your very own planet.  Procedurally generate infinite planet variations and terraform a selection of planets, even a mysterious ringed planet!<br><br><strong> Realistic and Detailed Space Probes and Satellites</strong><br><br> View numerous probes that have been sent to explore our planets and to discover more about our universe.
