Watch your counter meter and build the weapons your army needs. But be careful, if you supply your army with the wrong weapons, the orcs will win!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CRAFTING</strong></h2></h2>There is lots of work to do in the goblin gear shop so divide the tasks properly!

Then you’re giving the orcs a big advantage (so don’t do that, okay?). Make sure that not only you but also your goblin friends are performing the skill checks well.
