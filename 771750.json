Watch as the bodies hit the floor swarmed by the confetti from Christmas firecrackers or treat yourself to some lightshows with Christmas grenades.

Enjoy increased armor points and ammo capacity, protection against explosives and damage reduction with a Christmas vest.  Speed up your reloading and weapon switching with themed gloves, while your boots boost your sprint. Stay frosty with distinctive Christmas helmets unique in appearance for each class. Each of them offers increased head protection and decreased flashbang effect.<br><br>Winter has arrived!",
