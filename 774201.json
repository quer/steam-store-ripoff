            "reviews": "“There’s something about Inkle’s games though, the way every tiny choice branches in a dozen different ways, the way the Ink Engine resurfaces small decisions in interesting ways... What’s most amazing about Heaven’s Vault though is that every path feels valid... It’s—and I don’t say this lightly—like nothing I’ve ever played before... Safe to say Heaven’s Vault is one of my most anticipated games of 2018, and Inkle one of the most exciting studios working today.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3268992/gaming/heavens-vault-preview-inkle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC World</a><br><br>“This science fiction adventure is a very exciting thing indeed.
