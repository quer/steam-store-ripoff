Initially a small batch of pre-series locomotives, classified as the BR 181, were built in 1966 and put to the test; engineers analysed them and their unique dynamic braking abilities. 4 of these locomotives were built, two were known as the BR 181.0 and the others were the BR 181.1s.<br><br>As time rolled on, DB expressed their need for a fleet of locomotives which could haul cross-border traffic, and more and more wires were being erected on routes across Germany and France. The BR 181 had its chance, it was originally developed as a dual-power locomotive, to work on different electrification systems, and was selected as the basis for a series of 25 locomotives. Some changes were made however, and so the new fleet, which was built between 1974 and 1975, was dubbed the BR 181.2.<br><br>Weighing in at 84 tons a piece, the BR 181.2 fleet was capable of 160 km/h operation and were quickly put to work on express passenger services, connecting Germany and France, and traversing the Mosel Valley.
