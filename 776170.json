I decided not to take the risk to dissapoint you for buying a multiplayer game and have a small chance to find players for battle at the current stage. So I spend the last weeks to develop some really good and missing features for the starting phase of the game when there are maybe not much players online. Here are the most important ones:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Local Splitscreen / Couch CoOp - play on one PC with up to 4 player AND optional online against the web<br></li><li>Bots - you can practise your skills against some bots in an arena and check out all the weapons. This is mainly designed as a playground and you'l find there the latest developments and features<br></li><li>Controller support - it was a requirement for Slitscreen - so here it is - you can use your XBOX or Steam Compatible Controller through the entire game<br></li><li>Solo Mode - or at least some kind of :) no, not a story mode, seriously, but there is coming a &quot;boss&quot; the next weeks you can battle against</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Dear Bob,</strong><br><br>I know you know that feeling ... monday morning - sitting in the office - and you only want to go home. Your work is boring, your collegues stupid - so what should you do?<br><br>Easy peasy my friend - just get your gun and blow em away! But wait! Not that bloody, rude one - there's no real fun in them ... use the one just hurting - hit by hit!<br>So equip your foam blaster and get some!<br><br><strong>Sincerely, your CEO</strong><br><br><i>PS,<br>Please don't smash the whole facility, again. We want to release a new floor with more room for you soon.</i><br><br><strong>The Gameplay</strong><br>Load your gun, shoot your enemies, fight your way to the next lood or a dropped weapon - get it, and get it quick!<br><br><strong>The Environment</strong><br>A massive, handcrafted office facility is waiting for you. For early acess we open the first, smaller office area to get you startet. Feel free to reshape some furniture with your guns, it is YOUR office<br><br><strong>The Weapons</strong><br>At the moment you have 3 weapons. Our <i>Ballermann</i>, shooting some midsize foams, the <i>Speedster </i>- small projectiles but a lot of them, and the <i>Cleaner </i>- slow rolling bigboys making some space in front of you<br><br><strong>The Characters</strong><br>We don't have employees at the moment, beside of Bob. But we have some applications in the queue",
