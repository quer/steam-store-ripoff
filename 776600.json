The player can dodge, parry, and unleash a deadly combo or use special attacks to quickly overpower the enemy, who are also capable of the same. Combat in this game relies heavily on player's fast reaction and strategy. Also worth noting, most of the combat animations are high quality, motion-captured.<br />\r\n2<br />\r\nThe story<br />\r\nThe best part of the game is the plot. The main plot is the contention that the forces of all sides revolve around a legendary treasure. There are fierce robbers, cruel Imperial Knights, fallen lord, sea fleet, mercenaries, mysterious witches, and so on. Different identities and vivid characters. With the ups and downs of the plot, the player may feel that the enemy is hiding behind him. Sometimes he can't distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys, and sometimes he is involved in plots and lies. Sometimes, he is touched by some sincere hearts. The protagonist is not a hero to save the world, but he dare to do what he thinks is right, not for fame and gain, nor for justice, nor for love, but for the beauty he has been searching for.",
