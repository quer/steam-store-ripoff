Chances are, you'll never forget it for the rest of your life. If you have a heart, it's a very impacting experience.

Thank you.”<br>U.S.A Appstore User review 1<br><br>“This visual novel tries to move your heart by taking a cliche about never giving up and turning it into something more, something that pierces your heart.”<br>U.S.A Appstore User review 2<br><br>“A very touching visual novel.
