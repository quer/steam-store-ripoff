Contains excessive violence and gore depicted via full-screen art stills, textual descriptions, and Japanese-language voice-acting, specifically including the mutilation, torture, and murder of children. Also contains images of female anime-style characters with exposed underwear or cleavage, shown in restraints, or in one instance shown bathing together with strategically placed steam to cover up private areas. Numerous examples of foul language can be found in translated text, including slurs such as \"b*tch\" and heavy swears such as \"f*ck.\""
