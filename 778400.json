Contains a few images with disturbing content such as bloody corpses. Also contains images of female anime-style characters with exposed underwear or cleavage, and, in a few instances, being groped by other female characters or monstrous tentacles. Contains textual descriptions of suggestive situations, often for humorous effect, such as masochism and a female teacher’s crotch being pushed into a male student’s face. Numerous examples of foul language can be found in translated text, including slurs such as \"b*tch\" and heavy swears such as \"f*ck.\""
