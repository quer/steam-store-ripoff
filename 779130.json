Online combat latency smoothing<br>It is obvious to many knowledgeable minds, that a PvP melee action game, especially in VR, requires for a very strict connection speed. VFC has made an attempt to smooth out the game-play even under higher latency environment, and during both our internal and closed beta tests, the results are positive, that even under high latency environment (~250 pings), the game can still be played with a reasonable satisfaction</strong><br><br>2. Frame to frame accuracy in PvP melee combat interactions<br>     • Each ‘physical assault’ is tracked based on its speed of movement and calculated to quantify their power and hence translate into damage dealt with each hit.<br>     • A sandbox fighting experience using true physics calculation on the strength of your attacks. You should perform the proper punching technique not because the game tells you to, but because it is actually THE better way to win a game.<br>     • Highly accurate real-time hit-box recognition (many games suffers from this, because VR tracking doesn't perform well under high-speed movements, but VFC solved this problem with high satisfaction.)<br>     • The player can parry, and dodge with highly intuitive sensory accuracy.<br><br>3. Real-time body posture reconstruction - enabling all your boxing moves<br>     • Using only the handheld VR controllers, VFC simulates the player’s body posture using reverse engineering mechanics, so, inside the game, your in-game avatar will track your actual body movements quite closely (of course let's not pretend weird things wouldn't happen haha!)<br><br>4. Motion Sickness Free<br>We have had thousands of game trails with different individuals when we exhibited VFC at 2016 PAX AUS and received no feedbacks of motion sickness.<br><br><img src=\"https://%CDN_HOST_MEDIA_SSL%/steam/apps/779130/extras/Capture.PNG?t=1547699412\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br><i>*search for tech issue or bug, visit <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.vfcgame.com/tech-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://www.vfcgame.com/tech-faq</a></i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Supported VR Headsets:</h2><br>HTC VIVE is fully supported<br><br>For Oculus, to get the best experience a 360 degree tracking is optimal, but without 360, the game is still good (we tested the game using only 180 degree tracking, and we felt it played quite well)<br><br>We haven't tested extensively for WMR just yet (will do in the near future), but we had a WMR user in our closed beta test, and he didn't experience any major issue<br><br>Full body tracking using either VIVE trackers or supporting gears for Oculus and other compatible headsets (to enable kicking!) will be added to single-player and Co-op mode later down the road depending on community demands.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play area requirement</h2>More space you have the merrier, but VFC should be played with a minimum space of 1.5 metre x 2 metre, which is equivalent to 4.9 feet x 6.5 feet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Internet connection and online PvP</h2>We recommend you to use cable internet connection, as the wireless connection will cause small graphic lags.<br><br><br>The game uses NAT punch through to pair up the P2P connection between players, but if the connection punch-through failed, we do have a relay server to backup the connection (but that will cause higher than optimal latency level). <br><br>If you want a guaranteed optimal connection quality every time, please enable your router's UPnP setting (universal plug and play), so that the P2P connection will be much more stable. <br><br>Each brand and model of router varies in its navigation menu to change the UPnP setting.
