Help Bob to escape a mysterious time loop along with his companion AI while fighting off a full scale Replicon alien invasion. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/780390/extras/GameplayBanner.jpg?t=1547470745\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Explore dozens of planets while mastering the physics techniques required to lift loot and resources back into orbit where they can be refined to craft much needed upgrades.<br><br><br>At first, something as simple as landing on a planet and recovering some basic salvage will be a serious challenge. If the planetary hazards don't kill you first you'll likely be overrun by Replicons before having a chance to learn that you need to be both fast and smart to survive. Managing resources while learning how to maneuver valuable loot around obstacles, and out of deep winding caves, is at the heart of Bob's adventure. <br><br>Your first objective will be to escape through the jump gate but even if you manage that you'll find yourself transported back in time to discover that it's only the beginning of your battle against the Replicons. To truly escape you'll need to explore further, solve mysteries, meet new friends, complete multiple objectives and master your skills to ultimately take the battle deep into the Replicon mothership itself.<br><br>Whether you live or die, an average play session is designed to be relatively short yet never the same twice. At first, you'll die frequently and struggle to do seemingly simple tasks but with patience, careful resource management, time and practice you'll learn to survive long enough to unlock checkpoints and discover that death is not as permanent as it seems. Dig even deeper and you'll find yourself working with mysterious forces to save mankind from alien obliteration over multiple consecutive games.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/780390/extras/WireframeExample2.png?t=1547470745\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Technology</h2>The game may initially appear to use traditional 2D sprites but instead uses polygons to model every object, planet, and blade of grass. This allows for both surprisingly great performance, even on low end hardware, but also the ability to seamlessly zoom from viewing an entire planet down to allowing Bob to fill the screen without any pixelation. <br><br><br>At the start of each game a new system of planets is generated, each remixed and respawned with different resources and loot to create an open-world experience where no two games are ever alike. <br><br>All objects are physics enabled which creates the heart and soul of the gameplay. You'll need to master Bob's multi-functional grappling gun, that can connect anything to everything, and use it to solve an emergent stream of physics based problems in order to get loot and resources back to your refinery ship in orbit. Bob's grappling gun can even stick Replicons to walls, each other, or anything else before they eventually overwhelm every planet. Alternatively, you can blast them to pieces and salvage their body parts or take things to the next level and salvage them alive!<br><br>Good luck, Bob. You've got this!",
