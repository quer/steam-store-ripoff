The civilization started crumbling years ago, but you still do your job, trying to protect the guard house in any way you can, as mutant zombies try to overrun it.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br>-Day-night cycle<br><br>-Weapons ranging from melee to guns, like crowbar, blowtorch, revolvers,bombs, and ofcourse your best friends: Turrets. (many more to come)<br><br>-Turret assembly: Assemble turrets from parts found around the house, and set them up with an antenna so you can monitor the turrets<br>battery, ammo, and signal strength!<br><br>-Zombies!
