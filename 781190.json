This Map Pack contains 4 new battle maps for custom and multiplayer battles in Total War: WARHAMMER II.<br><br>These maps offer striking visions of the High Elven lands, with a focus on their highly magical landscape. The Steps of Isha consists of four adjacent battlefields situated on different tiers, with a malignant corruption breaking down the surrounding lands. The maps are visually related, with similar elements appearing throughout, including a magical statue in each map facing the central tower. <br><br>From a gameplay perspective, the focus is on formidable defensive positions that discourage direct attacks, but are vulnerable to indirect approaches. The four maps of the Steps of Isha are:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Steps of Isha: Pit of Thorns (Land battle)<br></li><li>Steps of Isha: Broken Hills (Land battle)<br></li><li>Steps of Isha: Heartlands (Land battle)<br></li><li>Steps of Isha: Shining Summit (Free-for-all battles)</li></ul>",
