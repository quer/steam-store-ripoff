You hear a loud noise and rush to the window to see one of your beloved cows being tractor beamed into a space ship. Grabbing your best pair of overals you hustle out to save her, then you realize, you are in the tractor beam!! There is no going back it seems as you are lifted 100 feet in the air, nooooo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou end up on a foreign planet, and the only way you can get back to earth is to farm for the alien who abducted you. Maybe if you gain enough money, or find another way... You can get back to Earth! Luckily Sillion has an extra Space Farming Gun available for you to use, this is a lot easier than carrying around all those extra tools!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTurn a foreign land into a diverse farm. Unlock and purchase new crops which seeds can be printed on your 3D printer! Unlock more sections of land from your alien overlord, landlord.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpgrade your farming gun over time, unlock more space for items, minerals, fishing games, and collecting stuff. Don't forget to get to know the locals, but be careful, you will need to earn reputation with each of the different races of characters to earn enough favour to enter their businesses, and unlock new items!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTry selling your hard earned crops in the marketplace. You can choose to sell to different vendors with every chaning pricing and economy. Gain reputation with every dollar you spend!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nImproving your skills over time will help you along the way. Upgrade your bag space, your fishing abilities, your collecting skills to collect better and heavier items. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinding an indepth storyline deep in the forest might be for you. A main storyline awaits your exploration with intriguign characters and a comical storyline. Maybe there is more to living on an alien planet than meets the eye.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne hour of original modern music.",
