You are the one of a few that survived a virus that has infected most of the population and turned them into flesh-eating zombies. Play alone or team up with up to 4 friends and take on this challenge of survival in a harsh and brutal environment.<br><br>Zombie Watch is a top-down, open world survival game that will take you to a post-apocalyptic world, where you are going to encounter many different zombies and wildlife. Gather, mine, scavenge for resources and build a self-sustaining base with defenses to fend off the incoming zombie hordes. Craft or find weapons, armor, medicine and much more.<br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br><br>You wake up in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by bloodthirsty zombies that are after you around the clock. They can smell you from the distance, hear every step you take if you are not careful and make you their one and only target once they spot you. While living in hiding or fighting for your life, you also have to attend your basic human needs. It would be a shame if you perished of starvation or cold.
