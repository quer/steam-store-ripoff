You’re left to face the outside world alone, but this can be both difficult and amazing when you have autism. Just because you have it, doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy life.

Just like someone with autism.  <br></li><li>Some characters that the main character knows well, are not black outlines and have some detail. But they are still darkened. This represents how some with autism can learn someone’s body language if they have known them for a long time. <br> </li><li>In the game, every environmental sound gets represented on the sound sensitivity meter. The player must keep this under control, so the main character does not become overwhelmed. This represents Sound sensitivity in autism. <br></li><li>In conversations, the player again can’t read body language, as they are all black outlines.  But they must try and figure out how to respond with limited vocabulary. This represents the difficulty Aspies have in putting thoughts into sentences that people can understand. <br></li><li>Also in conversations, the player’s feeling meters of stress, happiness, courage and uneasiness will affect how a conversation plays out. For example, not much courage means you can’t look at the other person. <br></li><li>To regenerate the feeling meter, players must go into quiet places or do things that the main character enjoys. That being, playing video games. <br></li><li>The game’s art style of blue and purple, represent not just the 80/90s feel of the game but also social isolation.
