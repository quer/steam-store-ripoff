Before you dive in, there are some important notes that you need to be aware of...<br><br>• A joypad is essential to play The Alpha Device, as the game doesn't support mouse/keyboard input. The left stick controls movement, the right controls the viewpoint and the shoulder buttons control roll. Pause the game by pressing Start or the equivalent on your joypad.<br><br>• The game uses advanced rendering to paint the procedural world. Those of you with lower spec graphics cards will notice the resolution automatically adjusts itself to maintain an acceptable framerate as you move around. Initially, you may notice slight stuttering as the game works out the best resolution for the experience. However, playing in Windowed Mode won't improve the framerate (it's not that kind of rendering!).<br><br>• The Alpha Device is a retelling of the story from Caretaker Sacrifice. It was created to satisfy players who requested an experience that didn't require a VR setup to enjoy.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Beyond space, beyond reason... beyond humanity. Venture into the unknown depths of the universe and discover a gripping tale of a dystopian future that calls your very existence into question.<br><br>Narrated by David Hewlett, star of <i>Stargate</i>, <i>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</i> and the Academy Award-winning <i>The Shape Of Water.</i><br><br>The Alpha Device is a narrative experience focusing on story rather than puzzles or combat. Here, the story is all. You can discover each part of the story at your own pace, but the game is designed to be completed in one sitting - there is no save function and your progress will not be stored if you decide to stop playing.<br><br>Once you start the game, you're totally on your own. There's no main menu, no guidance, no tutorial. Just head towards the green light when you're ready to proceed...",

            "reviews": "“When you find a monolith you’ll discover part of the story, told from an astronauts perspective and narrated by the talented David Hewlett (Stargate, Planet of the Apes, Shape of the Water). To say too much about the story will ruin it, but needless to say it’s fantastic and tells a cleverly constructed sci-fi narrative that’s fondly reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke’s works.  It’s an incredible experience, with awe-inspiring visuals, a great audio score and a mature sci-fi narrative that throws up lots of philosophical and moral questions as you unravel a mystery at the end of the Universe. Very highly recommended.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.freegameplanet.com/the-alpha-device-download-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Free Game Planet</a><br>",
