He lit all evil with his fire, and burnt out to ash with them. After 49 days the fire finally burnt out, a sword appeared in the ash of the Phoenix. <br />\r\nBut tales are only tales. Time past by and the real story got buried in the dust. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nStoryline: <br />\r\nThe game is about stories which happened when Lin was following his junior fellow apprentice to go down the mountain for their martial art training. During their way, when passing the Tanglin City, they found Jolin Shen, a demon fox, was inciting and creating trouble there. Teaming up with disciples from the Treasure Pavilion, they caught Jolin Shen finally. But unexpectedly people from the Water God Sect were suspected of having been involved in it. Afterwards, along with Seven and Bai, they went to the Four Phase Mountain to explore the truth about the rumors on a legendary sword. However, when they spotted the conspiracy, it had been too late. Did what all happened stem from the Water God Sect? Or some sects else were behind? Were the following men related to the conspiracy, who covered Yuu, Lin’s junior fellow apprentice, a mild yet severe man? Seven, a well-behaved hunter?  Or Bai, who was mysterious and unsociable ? Or Yuun, who was always elusive?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPS.Trading Cards and Achievements will come out with the final version.",
