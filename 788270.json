It is an isometric game, inspired by the classics in many ways: a challenging environment to explore, choices with consequences, and a simple but versatile rulesystem enabling endless ways to develop your character. Each of your character stats will make a difference, and the world is highly reactive; new conversation options might be enabled with high intelligence, or vary depending of your standing with the many factions or your previous actions.<br><br><strong><u>Explore a vast world:</u></strong> no one will point you to the best hidden secrets in the <strong>135 areas</strong>. Talk to <strong>over 300 NPCs with unique dialogues</strong>, and solve <strong>90 quests</strong> ranging from the &quot;stereotypical&quot; menial tasks in early levels, to epic-scale plots full with twists and hard choices. Customize your character with <strong>70 skills</strong> and hundreds of different items. Overcome all kind of monsters and antagonists, choosing carefully the weapons or powers for each encounter if you want to have a chance. And return to the classical dungeon crawl, with traps and secret doors, and death awaiting the unwary adventurer behind every corner.<br><br>Exiled Kingdoms is a huge game, with content hand-crafted during 4 years of development and writing.
