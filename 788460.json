Get more out of your recordings as you know what exactly you need to pull out.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Compatible with every recorder and editing software</h2>The program shows you all your saved times. If you don't edit your own work, send this as well as whatever else you need to an editor and they can use the times.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How do I use the program?</h2>While recording content (on any device with any software), have TcNo TimeKeeper Demo open. When something noteworthy occurs that you or an editor needs to come back to in editing, press the hotkey you assigned to make a note of the time. When you or someone else is editing the video, they know exactly where to go and don't have to spend hours scrubbing through video finding good parts, missing hundreds on the way. Spending less time searching allows creators to create better final products.<br>The program is lightweight, and designed to run in the background, without interrupting the user; making it perfect for Livestreamers, Podcasters and content creators alike to use it, without the audience even knowing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Easy to understand</h2>The program was created to be simple, and understandable by anyone. Once downloaded, set up the hotkeys you want, and if possible set the start/stop recording hotkey to the same as your recording software, so they both start simultaneously. While recording press the note keys to remember certain moments in the recording.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This is a demo for the Full Version of TcNo TimeKeeper</h2>Because of this, it has a lot of key features disabled. The program is still functional, and will allow you to speed up editing.<br>Consider purchasing the full version for features like:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Remote control from any WiFi enabled device.<br></li><li> Autosaving of times for easy access<br></li><li> Managing space on your PC, where 'empty' recordings (with nothing worth adding to a video) can be automatically deleted, after your recording.</li></ul>",
