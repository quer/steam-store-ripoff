            "reviews": "“Nick &amp; Willikins is a delightful game to play.  The voice acting is excellent and the game is exceptionally well written. Willikins had me smiling throughout the adventure and I was reminded of characters from the old BBC comedies such as Fawlty Towers or Are You Being Served?. He is intelligent, witty, sarcastic, and very British (it’s ‘colour’ NOT ’color’). He has a side comment for everything.”<br>-A – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://justadventure.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4130\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Just Adventure</a><br><br>“Extremely well voiced, highly amusing for the majority of the adventure, complete with smart puzzles that mimic the best of the genre, and all for the grand price of…nothing!”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.cubed3.com/review/4611/1/the-adventures-of-nick-and-willikins-pc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Cubed3</a><br><br>“For a free game made my a small independent developer, The Adventures of Nick and Willikins is pretty robust.
