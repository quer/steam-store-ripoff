To survive in this post-apocalyptic world you have to scavenge your surroundings and defend yourself against creatures and other players. You have to build a base, improve it and learn.

Through the ingenuity of humankind, mechanical beasts were created resembling animals, which were living in these habitats centuries back, to combat their new foes.

With no continued maintenance throughout the chaos of the war, errors in production were bound to occur. The beasts malfunctioned and began attacking everything living and breathing.<br><br>You are one of the few survivors, a mechanic, of what was once a great Victorian civilization. As your day starts and you are out completing an important quest, you come across a young dragon. You pity the injured cub, so you decide to save it and from this moment on it never leaves your side, and you eventually realize: this dragon is your new companion.
