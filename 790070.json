No? Anyways, Bouldering Brawl is a mountain climbing racing game for couch and online play.

Play unique and humorous characters and win on the various mountains of the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Aesthetics, Strange Characters, Items &amp; Obstacles </h2>Play with an unique low poly graphic style: Battle <span class=\"bb_strike\">oddly</span> humorously designed characters (you played many devils on vacation in your gaming career yet?), throw Clown-Sound grenades at your opponents, dodge swinging alphorns, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play Against Your Friends On The Couch &amp; Online</h2>We all know it - what would Mario Kart be without that moment when you get hit by a blue shell fired by some last placed idiot? And all the cursing and taunting after that?
