The game starts off in the Appalachian Mountains at a mountainside trading post. Talk to people at the trading post to learn how to get started. Here you can buy some starter gear and head off into the mountains. You can freely hike around the mountains and learn survival skills, or you can accept one of the challenges from the Trading post to receive a reward and maybe some extra skill points if you complete the challenge. As you gain more experience, you will be able to craft more items do more things. While on your Hiking and Camping you can gather extra herbs and other items, and sell them to the trader for some extra cash. The cash can then be used to better your gear. After you have reached enough experience, the piece of land beside the trading post will be available to you at a price. Raise some money and buy the land to start building a full out BugOut home and prepare for the upcoming world-changing event. You can even make it completely self-sufficient and Off-grid with solar power and a water well. If you want you can also choose to grow and jar your own food or use the money to buy long-term storable food. Upgrade your home to survive many different scenarios or if you really want to go all out build a bunker, then stockpile your bunker with everything you think you will need.Be sure get a radio or PC so you can keep up with what is going on, you never know when the time will come that you will need to BugOut.<br><br><br>Be sure get a radio  so you can keep up with what is going on, you never know when the time will come that you will need to BugOut.<br><br><br><br>Will you be prepared?<br><br><br>Prepare as much as you can, an event can happen at random times. <br>Increase your skills in hunting, fishing, herbalism, building and much more.
