Each Minotaur is trapped in their half of the split screen – but only in a combined effort can they escape the cursed labyrinth.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/791470/extras/gifUnderworldP.jpg?t=1528197594\" ><br><br>In this impossible maze, you can merge both halves of the split screen into one and thus hop from one side of the screen over to the other. Use this ability to your advantage! It’s up to you to rearrange and manipulate the level structures of 30 carefully crafted levels in order to carve out a path to the exit.
