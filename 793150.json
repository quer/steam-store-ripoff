Your own, unique story awaits you! These large-scale love story games are different from either anime, manga or romance novels but are just as enjoyable. Get close with your favorite girl and enjoy school life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nABOUT MOE! NINJA GIRLS:<br />\r\nYou're a genius ninja that hides your true identity and transfers to Mizaki School.<br />\r\nSurrounded by girls your age, you finally get the peaceful everyday school life that you've always longed for. After a series of events, you end up starting a &quot;Ninja Seeking Club&quot; at school to find ninjas! As you spend your days busy with girls and club activities, you start to discover the true identities of your fellow club members... Can you unmask your favorite girl's identity? And what's the big secret behind Mizaki School?\t<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYOUR CUTE GIRLFRIENDS:<br />\r\nAkari Hanao – “We're in the same class...and our seats are so close...it's gotta be fate, right?!”<br />\r\nA classmate of yours. She always thinks positively, though sometimes she is too starry-eyed. Active, athletic, and relatively smart, she livens up the party, while also sometimes getting herself and the people around her in trouble. She admires ninjas and comes up with the idea to set up a &quot;Ninja Seeking Club&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnju Saion-ji – “Oh well... If you're having trouble, I suppose I can tell you whatever you need to know.”<br />\r\nA classmate of yours. She is a member of the student council and is smart as well as agile. Can seem commanding at times, but is actually caring by nature, so she takes care of Akari despite often being dragged into trouble by her. Does not show people how she lives her private life. Rumor says she comes from a millionaire family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRicka Machiyuki – “No problem. Don't think about who is behind you. Just take your lessons.”<br />\r\nA classmate of yours, who transferred right after you. Always stays quiet and poker-faced, creating a mysterious mood around her. From time to time she says things that sound unsettling, but her classmates hope that she is only joking. Likes video games. Loves fried noodle hotdogs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFEATURES:<br />\r\n* Beautiful artwork, alluring soundtracks and motion effects<br />\r\n* Multiple endings depending on the choices you make<br />\r\n* Cute costumes in Japanese anime style with constant updates<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU:<br />\r\n- Love romance novels or movies<br />\r\n- Love Japanese games, manga, novels or anime<br />\r\n- Are interested in dating sim games but prefer something more simple<br />\r\n- Want to enjoy being in love with a variety of women<br />\r\n- Want to have a love affair without anyone knowing<br />\r\n- Are crazy about Ninjas<br />\r\n- Love romance games / dating games for free <br />\r\n- Love fashion and dressing up your partner<br />\r\n- Enjoy reading fiction with grand setting<br />\r\n<br />\r\nABOUT OUR COMPANY:<br />\r\nNTT Solmare is one of the largest digital contents providers in Japan including Digital Book (e-Book) Enterprise and Game Enterprise.",
