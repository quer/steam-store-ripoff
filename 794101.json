            "detailed_description": "The Stinson L-5 is typical of the type of aircraft developed during WWII for duties such as liaison, artillery spotting, photo-reconnaissance and casualty evacuation. Rugged and dependable, the design is a true 'work horse', showing little to no concern for aesthetics and equipped with no unnecessary embellishments. It simply does what it says on the tin.<br><br>The L-5 was dubbed 'The Flying Jeep' and, along with the Stinson L-1 Vigilant, was the only other American liaison aircraft of WWII that was purpose-built for military use. Other types were used, of course, but they tended to be converted from existing commercial designs such as the Piper Cub.<br><br>Nearly all Perspex, the cockpit area affords excellent visibility in all directions and the large door windows  fold down to give uninterrupted viewing below. The design was created to be multi-functional and versions of the L-5 were produced to operate as air ambulances and carry small amounts of freight, munitions and other cargo. Its primary use was as a front-line liaison aircraft and artillery spotter.<br><br>The L-5's supreme ability to get into small, remote areas earned it great respect from the generals and troops alike, and L-5s dropped much needed medical supplies, munitions, food and other provisions to hard-pressed troops in remote areas. L-5s were also used to guide fighter-bombers to their targets by radio communication and flare drops.<br><br>Seeing service in WWII and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, to name but three, Sentinels have flown across deserts, operated from dense jungle airstrips and in freezing conditions of snow and ice. Wherever they were operating, pilots could depend on an aircraft that would always get them through, and any pilot that flew the L-5 came away with a new-found respect for this little 'can do' aeroplane.<br><br>Today, many Sentinels have found their way into private hands and provide an inexpensive entry into the world of warbird ownership. They make excellent glider tugs and as simple, rugged sports aircraft are a source of pure fun in today's high tech aviation world.<br><br>Aeroplane Heaven's Stinson L5 comes in seven liveries and has been built from factory engineering drawings and is highly detailed down to individual rivets and fabric effects.<br><br>The highly realistic pilot and observer are fully animated and other unique animations include aileron droop.
