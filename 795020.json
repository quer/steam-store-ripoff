Depending on the chosen difficulty, the required percentage is 45%, 60% or 75% (easy, normal, hard). Once you have collected the required amount, you will see the message &quot;Find the exit!&quot;. <br><br>There are also 7 letters (C, H, A, R, L, I, E) that you can collect in each level. Collecting them is not required for 100%, but they may help you find areas you haven't explored yet, since the letters are generally layed out from left to right<br><br>The game can run using either OpenGL or DirectX (Options, Video, Graphics).
