Burroughs said, “a broader, general view of things.”  Dhalang (the name derives from the puppet-master in the Indonesian shadow puppet theater) by the Finnish developer Joel Kivela does at least four different things, and it does each of them well.  It’s a microtonal tuning utility, a series of sound generators, a traditional DAW-type sequencer, a series of algorithmic generators, and a mixer.  It can both receive and send out MIDI.  It can be used as a complete all-in-one solution for composition, or it can be used in conjunction with other programs, or MIDI input and output programs. You’ll find it has a range of possibilities that will keep you occupied for not hours or days, but months on end.&quot; Warren Burt / Sound Bytes Magazine<br />\r\n<br />\r\n---- <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHave you ever wanted to sequence electronic and electro-acoustic music with authentic alternative tuning systems e.g. Indian or Arabic, and their distinct musical scales ? How about generating totally unique tuning systems and exploring their new sonic frontiers with traditional piano roll notation or with more adventurous algorithmic and stochastic sequencers ? Even though not an entry level music software, Dhalang requires no special musical training and only a refined ear for music and sound that go beyond the mainstream. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDhalang MG consists of internal synthesizers and samplers all tunable to any tuning system. Internal mixer with multi-effect buses provides complete track production within the single software. Stereo or multichannel audio output can be rendered to wav offline or online while playing or mixing live. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSequencers use scale subsets that allow very easy and fast grid-based creation of the most hypnotic, catchy or complex sequences possible. Algorithmic sequencers based on vector progression, Markov chains and physics generate musical sequences in a similar fashion to modular synthesis; Different operators and principles guide pattern or stochastic -based endless flow of notes that control internal instruments or external MIDI devices and software. With multiple state machines, algorithmic sequencer states can be in turn sequenced and interpolated in a song-like way. All different types of sequencers can even be linked and synced together allowing endless original musical possibilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUPD Network connection allows multiple instances of Dhalang to sync tempo to one another and for exchanging tuning systems and scales.",
