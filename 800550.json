He died fighting beside the great King Blackshield himself. Fighting against the Dark Remnant's undead army. <br><br>After the battle, his body was returned to his home kingdom. It was laid to rest in a grand mausoleum with his powerful sword. But this was not to be the end of the story for his sword.<br><br>Rumors have begun to be spread as of late. Sir Weryn's magic sword has been said to have returned from the grave. But it is no longer the righteous blade it once was. It is now said to be cursed with evil.
