Harder still is to notice someone suffering without them telling you, many find out only when it's too late. We all look back and think, &quot;Is there something I could have done?&quot; If you look hard enough, you can find different choices, but only when you look back knowing what you know now. <br><br>College, a fun time for some, a bad time for others. All have hopes and dreams, but some demons pull them down to a hole they can't climb out of. Life changes based on the smallest things, and those who suffer can sometimes see a light to help escape the darkness, or be forever wrapped in it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">[4 unique endings.]</ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">[2 playable characters.]</ul><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">[Unique characters and areas to explore.]</ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Small note with minor spoiler</h2><br>This is all based on my experiences on both sides of the isle.
