Choose your heroes, build your deck, and save Vitrerran.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Real-Time Card Game</h2><br><strong>The Land of Glass</strong> is a new kind of card game, one where combat doesn't go back and forth in precise turns but operates in real time. The strategy and synergy of typical CCGs is present; however, you'll need more than that to succeed. The monsters won't wait for you to choose your best cards.<br><br>Combat takes place over two ever-changing grids: attack and defense. Punish your foes with big, heavy blows or swift strikes while countering with a steady stream of defense cards. Use magic to infuse your attacks with fire, ice, explosions, and more; lay traps; burn away defenses; and slow your opponents down for some needed breathing room.<br><br>Magic is not confined to simply attacking and defending, though. Alter the playing field itself with massive spells, from fields of fire to lightning storms to man-eating plants. There are nine different types of magic to find, and experimenting is key to survival.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Character-Driven Story</h2><br>A knight is sent on a quest he cannot complete.

Each character is forced to explore the world for the first time, to confront his biases and misconceptions as he tries to stop a magical plague that threatens to eat the continent.
