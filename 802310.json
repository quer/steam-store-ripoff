The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Notes for Tracker Users</h2></strong><br><br>If you are a user using Tracker, pay attention to this article.<br><br>The basic settings in PingPong Kings VR are two controllers, the left controller means a ball for a serve, and the right controller means a racket.<br><br>If you want to use the tracker that is attached to the racket, turn off one of the controllers and then connect the tracker.
