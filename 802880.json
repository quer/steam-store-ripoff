What begins as a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy ultimately transforms into an action-packed thrill ride in a war-torn alternate reality, and it’s this drastic-yet-methodical genre twist that makes the final chapter the most highly-revered visual novel of all time. This is a story that will plant seeds in your brain early in the first act that you won’t even notice until they sprout in the third for maximum narrative payoff and crushing emotional impact. Don’t fall for Extra’s cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest thematic territory you’ll ever see, and when the final curtain closes, you’ll likely need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other.<br><br>This game contains the first two arcs: <strong>Extra, and Unlimited</strong>. <br>The final arc, <u><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/802890/MuvLuv_Alternative/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  ><strong>Muv-Luv Alternative</strong></a></u> is the story’s massive climax, and is nearly the size of the first two combined.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Muv-Luv Extra</h2><br>Takeru is your average unassuming high school senior whose entire world gets turned upside down one morning when he awakens to find himself in bed with the heiress to one of the world’s largest international conglomerates.

This comes much to the chagrin of his childhood friend Sumika, the girl next door who’s always had feelings for him, who realizes that if she doesn’t act fast, she might just lose him forever. All of which begs the question: just who is Meiya? And do his feelings for Sumika run deeper than he thought?
