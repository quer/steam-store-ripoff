In that time, he’s been through an awful lot — enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN contingency plan known as Alternative IV — a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched to a halt when the project’s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit a wall in her research due to technological constraints. With tensions rising, and pressure to shift gears from governments all across the world, the UN delegation opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative V. This was humanity’s last resort — a plan that utilized all of their remaining resources to build a migrant fleet of interstellar craft, allowing a tiny fraction of the population to abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru and his comrades-in-arms were among those left behind, condemned to death by their fellow man.<br><br>But it seems the hand of fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because it’s at this point that he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you — but back where he was first spat out into this hellscape three years prior. This was no dream; this was a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. If he’s truly been sent back in time, then he’s the only one who knows of the impending doom that awaits this world. Perhaps he can use this knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. And who knows? If he can change history, then maybe — just maybe — he’ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn’t Sumika here?
