As having a car is one of the basic rights in society, every outcast can keep his auto in exile, so wasteland life has been built around the cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe core of the game is mass car battles, where each car could be modified with various improvements, such as flamethrowers, raws, shields, boarding or kamikaze devices, etc. You can either destroy an enemy group or just leave them behind, if all of your cars are fast enough. These battles take place on procedurally-generated wasteland roads, filled with obstacles suitable for landscapes where a battle has been started on the global map.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA global map is another important part of the game. Here you can find a wasteland with a couple of factions - each with a unique philosophy and lifestyle. Some of them are in the state of war, some temporarily at peace. There are economic system between them, with trading, raids and plundering and you can take part in any of this. Wasteland could change geographically after death of your hero, but the economic situation and the storyline will continue instead of resetting, so the next hero will face the consequences of your actions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollow our community to keep in touch and check out our development diaries as we publish them.",
