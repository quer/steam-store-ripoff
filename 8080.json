Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men follows the violent and chaotic journey of two men -  a flawed mercenary and a medicated psychopath - and their brutal attitude towards right and wrong. This volatile partnership combined with innovative technologies allow for an unparalleled gaming experience. <br>\t\t\t\t\tKane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men immerses players in an emotionally intense crime drama with unflinching action.  Io-Interactive's proprietary technology delivers fluid high definition graphics and lighting; highly destructible environments; massive crowd AI; single, co-op, and squad-based combat; a cinematic interface; and non-stop dialog between Kane and Lynch.  The title also features innovative two-player co-op and groundbreaking online game play.  <br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Tense and unpredictable experience</strong> - This is the violent and chaotic journey of two men: a flawed mercenary and a medicated psychopath.
