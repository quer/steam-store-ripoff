            "detailed_description": "<h1>Puzzle Boxes &amp; Downloadable Content</h1><p>It is important to note from the start that the puzzle boxes for our game are delivered in the form of DLCs. A lot of these will be <i>completely free</i> if you own the base game and you will be able to get them as soon as they are made available. Others, mostly the illustrations provided by our partnering artists, will have to be purchased because artists are people too. We are aware of the controversy of DLCs and the love-hate relationship between them and gamers all over the world. However, there are some good reasons for us to structure the game in such a way.<br><br>First, we plan to provide you with new high-quality content on a regular basis. The easiest way to release that content quickly and efficiently is via DLC packages. Second, the UHD quality of our illustrations means that each puzzle box might often be well over 100 Mbs in size. You should not have to download tens of gigabytes of content that you might not currently need to play the game. And last but not least, the diversity of the art we plan to provide will often make certain puzzles click with different people. It is important that the right content for our diverse players can be found easily and quickly.<br><br>Remember, you <i>don't have to</i> acquire all of the DLCs for Masters of Puzzle. You only need to get the puzzle boxes you like and want to collect and play with.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Do you love jigsaw puzzles? So do we. Regrettably, we are not building as many as we would like to. The reasons are usually simple: not enough personal time to spend on hours-long sessions, not enough space at home to keep a half-finished puzzle around for days, no friends around to help you build when you want to, or some combination of all three.<br><br>That’s why we want to give you the ultimate jigsaw puzzle experience with our new game Masters of Puzzle. It’s a full 3D, physics enabled, beautiful simulation that you can enjoy whenever you want with whomever you want. Store your progress on any puzzle and resume at your convenience. Invite friends and loved ones for great multi-player experience or enjoy a solo relaxed session just for you. Keep track of your and your friends' accomplishments, customize your playroom, enter into contests, and do so much more. Our incredible game aims to give you as much flexibility and entertainment as possible.<br><br>Now, let’s delve deeper into the main features of Masters of Puzzle and see what makes it a special and different game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complete 3D Simulation</h2>Forget about flat, boring, 2-dimensional puzzle building. It’s so last century. Instead, let us introduce you to the pleasure of building realistic jigsaw puzzles in a fully simulated, beautiful environment with active physics. Interact with surfaces, items, and the puzzle tiles themselves as if you’re standing in front of (or above) your real-world puzzle table. Use the same approach and habits you’ve always used before – but in a purely virtual scene instead.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedurally Generated Puzzles</h2>All of our puzzles are generated procedurally based on a huge number of settings – some of these even adjustable by yourself in the game options. Each puzzle box can be sliced and distributed into one of the available box sizes at the start of each individual game. Furthermore, the form and disposition of the puzzle tiles can be completely changed when you create a new game even if you still use the same image and box size. Replay your favorite puzzles again and again with a fresh challenge every single time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Complexity &amp; Challenge For Every Taste</h2>Speaking of challenge, our current puzzle box sizes include sets of 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, and 4000 tiles. The game aims to provide suitable configuration for every occasion or skill level – both for beginners and hardcore veterans alike.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Play With Friends Or Strangers (Currently Unavailable in Early Access)</h2>Single player might be satisfying at times, but building jigsaw puzzles with others is where the real fun begins. We plan to include a fully fledged multiplayer, managed by dedicated virtual servers in the Cloud. Maintain friends lists, chat with others in-game or in the general lobby, create or join multiplayer online games both with people you know or complete strangers by using our matchmaking system. Resume your online game at any time with or without the others being present. Leave messages as sticky notes and discuss strategy even if you’re not all present at the same time.*<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customizable Playroom (Currently Unavailable in Early Access)</h2>Is realistic simulation not enough for you? Good, because this planned feature will allow you to fully customize your playroom and environment with high-quality materials and custom-crafted vanity objects that you can earn in the game by various means or purchase in our in-game vanity shop, once it's made available. Unwind your imagination and make your playroom as unique as you might want.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Listen to Your Own Music (Currently Unavailable in Early Access)</h2>Building puzzles in a silent environment might not be fun for everyone. That’s why we plan to provide you with the functionality to play your music of choice while solving your next jigsaw challenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Expand Your Puzzle Collection</h2>The base game comes with a good selection of free puzzles for you to enjoy. At some point though, you might want to try out new or different images. We plan to provide you on a regular basis with new collections of beautiful puzzles in various styles and painted by different artists. This new content in the form of DLC will adhere to the same replayability rules as the base content.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">And Much More…</h2>These are just the main features either available or planned for Masters of Puzzle, but there are also many others that you will find once you start playing. Additionally, we have plans to expand the game with regular updates and new features as we move forward. Contact us and share what else you’d like to see in the game.<br><br><br>* <i>Note: Multiplayer and all online services will require an active Internet connection as well as an active player account in our systems. However, you can still play solo without access to the Internet.</i>",
