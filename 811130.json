            "short_description": "This experimental short story is more of an interactive experience than a &quot;game&quot;. It is based on an original story by Catalina Leon and presented through key moments over several days. Play as Greg who must decide whether lapses in his memory are just paranoia, or something more sinister.",

It's controlled by the mouse, so it's easy to interact with everything.  But Pinhead Games has broken out of the usual 'adventure mold', and given us a slightly different  way of interacting with Greg and his world. If you're in the mood for a gripping story, look no further than Forever Space!”<br>4.1 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.reloaded.org/download/Forever-Space/645/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Reloaded</a><br>",
