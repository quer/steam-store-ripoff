Reconnecting these islands through ancient gates is an essential part of moving forward. Accomplishing this task requires traversing steep cliffs, deadly enemies, and cursed waters. All taking place in a fully dynamically lit open world during day or night. As you further explore the islands you may find points of power that you can absorb to grow stronger.<br><br>Bring a sword to a gun fight. Not only did the invaders bring firearms with them, but their presence alone has rekindled a darkness that was thought to have been sealed away. Using supernatural agility and deadly katana skills is the only way to rid the land of darkness.",
