Attach to walls and swing through the environment on a beam of energy code named “Polarity Hook” as you battle enemies and fight to save human kind!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><br><br><strong>Movement VR:</strong><br>Navigate the VR environment with our revolutionary new movement system!  Run, jump, and interact with the environment in a way that feels right and keeps you in the action.  Our team has worked hard to bring the fun and excitement of your favourite PC platformers to the VR experience.

Weather your running and gunning, shooting around corners, taking cover, punching doors, or just lobbing grenades; we have designed the experience to be as immersive and exciting as possible using every aspect of VR to its fullest potential.  Your arsenal is strong but the enemy may be stronger.  Will you be able to master each weapon and give yourself the edge needed to succeed?<br><strong><br>Swing &amp; Slide:</strong><br>If you combine the free fall of skydiving, the adrenaline rush of zip lining, and the hairpin turns of racing; you'll just start to scratch the surface of how it feels to swing and slide through our VR world.  Combined with our ground movement and combat systems you'll be able to attach to surfaces and swing through your environment on your own personal combat roller coaster.

Civilization has retreated from the world into massive super metropolises leaving the environment to flourish without human intervention.  Humankind has spread to the stars colonizing neighboring systems; taking their first steps into a much larger arena.  This is when the Event happened.

Vincent has been studying their technology since the Event occurred and said he was on the verge of a breakthrough.  I hope that's true.  The sounds of battle are around us and yesterday there was an orbital bombardment that could have only come from one of our star ships.  Things must be really bad if they are willing to rain down that kind of destruction on the city.  I have no idea if my family was able to evacuate before the fighting began.  I must put that out of my mind though.  I've been selected to go into enemy territory tomorrow to retrieve tech from an abandoned storage facility.  It's the only way to finish Vincent's device and turn the tide of battle.  I can't fail, I won't fail!<br><br>Humankind might not get a second chance.</li></ul>",
