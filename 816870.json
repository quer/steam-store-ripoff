Kill Em All provides amazing music and gameplay, a campaign that is very enjoyable, with objectives, huge maps, different scenery and talk about ALL THE GUNS! lots of guns to play and dominate with. My favorite so far has to be the minigun! just mow down zombies and create yourself a clear path to the objective! (careful though, minigun has a cooldown (;) overall this game is create and completely worth 5.99$ cannot wait to see what future patches they will bring to the game!”<br />\r\nTimeReaper<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“this is a great game it is worth the money it is some damn good fps zombie shooting adventure i wish it had multiplayers put i love it the blocky style ♥♥♥♥ing cool”<br />\r\nspacelord557<br />\r\n",
