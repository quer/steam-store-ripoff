Create your own textures or apply<br />\r\nready-made ones onto the weapon models. Bump technology, i.e. creating surface relief<br />\r\nimitation, is featured among the program's tools.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have been able to simplify the process of creating weapon skins as much as it’s possible.<br />\r\nNow you do not need to install a bunch of various software to work with one model. All the<br />\r\nprocesses starting from loading the model and up to designing and publishing it into Steam<br />\r\nworkshop can be done with 3DCoat only. Watch the trailer above to get familiar with the program's features<br />\r\nand the process of publishing the ready-made files into Workshop_Workbench.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: The demo is fully functional and works in trial mode for 10 days. Once the trial period is over, you can purchase the full version of this software and hence receive a unique registration key that will be linked to your account.",
