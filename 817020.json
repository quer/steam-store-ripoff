Venture through morbid streets of the last city on a dying planet. Challenge a repressive regime under which your whole life is determined by which social caste you belong to. Save your child and find out if escape is possible.<br><br>Unholy takes place on a desolate planet where last members of the human race live in the Last City. This sprawling metropolis is divided between castes, and every day is shrouded in fear. Fear of being noticed by higher castes. Fear of being killed by a mysterious Plague that is slowly consuming the city Fear of being caught by one of the maniacs or mysterious beast that are going through the streets at night. <br><br>Gameplay is a mix of horror and stealth game, where for each challenge can be overcome in several different ways. Will you sneak through the guards unnoticed or will you resort to murder, leaving behind you a trail of blood as you fall into madness? As an outcast and a wanted person you have a unique chance to exploit the caste system and impersonate different members of society. Your playstyle is your own, but each has its consequences. <br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Engaging First Person Horror / Stealth gameplay<br></li><li>Explore a rich story behind Last City and Siadah’s desperate quest to save herself and her child<br></li><li>Immerse yourself in a uniquely dark environment never seen before.<br></li><li>Multiple ways to approach challenges through stealth, or through exploiting the city’s social order.<br></li><li>Take good care about your physical and mental health.
