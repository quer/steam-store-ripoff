            "detailed_description": "Asteroid Deflector is an indie game based on simple physics. You have to prevent asteroids from hitting a planet by changing their course with various projectiles (shells, laser beams, atomics...) while working with - or against - the gravity of a planet and a star. Also watch out for economics like money, weapon research, planet population and so on.<br><br>It's my first game done in spare time - but with a lot of dedication. Expect some hours of fun and a good laugh at the goofy story. There is also an endless game mode to hunt for high scores. Please don't expect a refined, multimillion blockbuster game. I'm always open to suggestions and improvements.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>- Career mode with 12 levels.<br>- Endless mode.<br>- 23 technologies for research, including four distinctive weapons and a mighty planetary force field.<br>- Manage money, infrastructure, population and keep the people motivated.<br>- Seven (YouTube friendly) spherical songs will help you get in the flow of deflecting asteroids.<br>- Atmospheric sound effects.<br>- Special endgame in story mode (maybe there is more to the asteroids...).<br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>- Simple physics-based fun.<br>- Don't destroy the asteroids (lame), deflect them!<br>- Asteroids burning up in the star generate money (because... why not?).<br>- Expensive research will improve your weapons.<br>- Impacts on the planet will decimate the population and their moral (may result in losing the game).<br>- After a first learning curve, the gameplay can get quite hypnotic or meditative.<br>- Unlimited continues in career mode, saves are done after each level.<br>- It's all about gravity, mass and kinetic energy - but in a fun way!<br><br><strong>FAQ</strong><br>* Are there costly ingame purchases or will there be expensive DLC?<br>- No ingame purchases, it's the full game. I'm working on a second campaign, it will be free for all current owners. But will raise the initial price a little for new customers.<br>* Is this a mobile port?<br>- No, but I may port it to mobile (and remove some features in the base version with the &quot;XL&quot; in the name, in case you were wondering).<br>* A space cannon would never work!!!1<br>- First of all - it's just a game. And maybe a search for &quot;Project HARP&quot; might suprise you.",
