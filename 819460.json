The game has been in development for 9 months and is scheduled for a Windows and Mac release with a stretch goal for a console release.<br><br>The Shell is a pilotable mech, controlled from an interior cockpit by a single pilot. The Shells are equipped with state-of-the-art armor and weaponry, track vital signs of the pilots, and are highly customizable and upgradable. Each Shell comes standard with a dual weapon loadout, close-range combat abilities and a unique special weapon.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/Gameplay.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>In Metal Shell: Neon Pulse your goal is to defend Earth and its extraterrestrial colonies from an invading alien race, the Cayrzac. You fight as one of three military heroes, tasked with destroying Cayrzac bases, stealing technology, and using that information to build weapons to use against them. Piloting your Shell, you’ll fight enemy ground forces and use their destroyed armor to repair your Shell when it takes damage. As you collect alien technology you will take it back to base and build custom weapons with it. The action is fast paced, requiring lots of running, jumping, and shooting. Each playable character will have their own unique play style and weapons system, allowing players to experience a variety of combat encounters.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/Story.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>In the year 2486, Earth has become a one-world government, where the primary focus of science has been to find new planets to live on, as Earth is not capable of sustaining life for much longer. Mars has been colonized, and scientists are looking for new planets for humans to live on. The Cayrzac’s home planet has been destroyed and they are looking for a new planet to call home. This alien species is highly intelligent and has top-notch military machinery, which they will use to invade Earth. Earth’s people must defend the incoming attack on Earth, Mars, and ultimately take the fight to the Cayrzac Mothership.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/keyFeatures.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br><u><strong>Local Co-Op</strong></u><br><br>The game will feature local co-op, and if the stretch goal is reached networked co-op modes. Each player will be able to choose one of the three pilots and can play through the story together.<br><br><u><strong>Upgrade System</strong></u><br><br>The upgrade system in Metal Shell: Neon Pulse will allow players to customize their Shells to their playstyles. Players will be able to choose their weapon load-outs and armor giving them different stats and different ways to defeat their enemies.<br><br><strong><u>Special Attack Crafting</u></strong><br><br>Each character has their own unique special attack which allows them to inflict devastating amounts of damage on their enemies. After gathering enough alien tech players will be able to craft their own unique special attacks giving them even more customization options.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/Enemies.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>The Cayrzac alien race consists of many different species, each bringing their own unique skills into the war against Earth. We have plans to bring to life another dozen or so enemies creating a truly intimidating army that our heroes must face. Here are just a few of the enemies that we’ve already created.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/Characters.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br><u><strong>Phoenix</strong></u><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/phoenix.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>Born into a military family as an only child, Phoenix found a calling for protecting Earth at a young age. When she was 13, her father was killed in battle, and at age 15 her mother met a similar fate. As both of her parents were high ranking officers, Phoenix was allowed to stay on base until she was 17, when she enlisted. Phoenix’s ambition allowed her to quickly climb the ranks until she left the military to become a mercenary at age 28. Colonel Williams, a long time family friend, contacted Phoenix and requested that she come back to Earth’s military to join the special ops team that was tasked with fending off the Cayrzac invasion. <br><br><strong><u>Jak</u></strong><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/jak.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>A true intellectual, Jak was raised by a loving family of computer scientists. He was always at the top of his class, graduating high school at age 12. Jak divided his time between writing computer code and playing sports and has excelled in both categories, winning science fairs and track and field events throughout his youth. At age 16, Jak was approached by a military recruiter to become a technology and weapons developer for Earth's military. By the time he turned 20, he decided he wanted to fight on the front lines. Jak served as a combat mechanic, fixing machinery in the heat of battle. At age 35, Jak has toyed with the idea of moving to a safer position within the military. That was until he was offered a spot in the special ops program to defend Earth.  <br><br><strong><u>Maddox</u></strong><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/maddox.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>Maddox, a seasoned veteran, is no stranger to war. At a ripe 46 years of age, Maddox is still kicking ass and taking names on the battlefield. Orphaned at birth, he never knew his parents and was bounced from foster home to foster home. As a troubled youth, the court system gave him a second chance to turn his life around when a judge offered him the options of an extended stay in jail or military service. He eventually went on to become the top weapons instructor and has racked up over 500 kills on the battlefield. Maddox makes for a much-needed addition to the special ops teams fight against the Cayrzac.  <br><br><strong><u>Colonel Williams </u></strong><br><br>John R. Williams, Colonel of the Earth Army, has served his planet since 2611. He was responsible for planning and supervising the Mars Defense Program from 2420 - 2424 and the success of Project Ice Storm during the invasion of Neptune from 2428 - 2430. Williams ran for President of Earth in 2431, where he lost to his opponent Ronald T. Reed, at which time he returned to the military to develop more advanced planetary defense systems. Williams specializes in robotics and defense strategies, allowing him to spearhead Project Fairweather, creating new Shells for advanced pilots. <br><br><strong><u>K.I.R.A.</u></strong><br><br>K.I.R.A., or Kinetic Interface Real-time Application, is a state-of-the-art, intelligent navigation and information system. Created to replace the Colossus system for the new Shell unit. K.I.R.A. is a self-teaching A.I. unit, capable of scanning environments, compiling data, and relaying messages to the pilot faster and more efficiently than Colossus. K.I.R.A. will automatically transfer its stored user data to a new Shell if the pilot chooses a new unit, even if that unit is destroyed. The system will relay data to and from HQ, delivering crucial evidence, delivering mission dossiers, and calling for backup when needed. K.I.R.A. is designed to form bonds with humans, allowing pilots to put greater confidence in the system. K.I.R.A. will analyze characteristics of a pilot, such as openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism, along with other traits, and restructure itself to work in the most efficient way possible with each individual pilot.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/bosses.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>So far we only have one boss in the game. The Hellbringer is a gigantic spider-like mech, programmed with a high-level A.I. This machine is used to tear apart cities and eradicate armed forces. The Hellbringer has two heads, which it deals different attacks from. The left head absorbs energy from the surrounding environment and unleashes a powerful sweeping photon beam attack, the right head emits a swarm of homing missiles that target nearby enemies. A rotating laser turret is located in the center of the machine that, when damaged, will retract momentarily in order to repair itself. A power core is buried beneath its metal exterior. Exposing the core and destroying it will bring down the machine. Data collected from the core may be used to create powerful weapons that can help stop the invasion.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/Art.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>The art style in Metal Shell: Neon Pulse takes into account the nostalgia for the 80’s and its classic neon aesthetic. The art has the sleekness of vector sprites and incorporates a mix of detailed backgrounds with the brighter more simplistic playable foregrounds, giving a sense of depth as the player explores the world. Animations are being created in Spine 2D, which lends to their smooth and unique look.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/819460/extras/music.png?t=1524750522\" ><br><br>The music of Metal Shell: Neon Pulse primarily draws inspiration from the 80’s soundscape. This includes musical devices such as vibrant FM Synthesis (Yamaha DX7 for the win!), radical electric guitar shredding, slick gated reverb, and an electric drum kit you have to hear to believe. Now add catchy melodies, innovative harmonies, and colorful arrangements and you have the music of Metal Shell: Neon Pulse.",
