            "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Mythic Monsters #18: Aberrations</strong></h2><br><i>Mythic Monsters: Aberrations</i> brings you a dozen and one misshapen mutants, from old-school monsters like the hideous otyugh, the brilliant but brutal tentacular roper, the clever cloaker, and the treasure-trap mimic, to newer hunters like the swift and sneaky choker. You'll find adaptational evolutions like the veiled master and the vampiric mist alongside the fondly remembered relics of long-ago genre-straddling mash-ups like the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing or the fabulous froghemoth! A few aberrations have folkloric roots like the deadly ettercap, while others are stitched together out of nightmarish pieces like the vemerak, or had their birth on a toy shore shelf like the legendary rust monster! To this august assemblage, of aberrations CR 3 to 17, we present a brand-new beast, the zyoselak, a floating multi-segmented swarm of gelatinous horror that is quite literally brain-meltingly deadly! As if this were not enough, we also bring you 9 mythic spells for making mythic mutants of your very own!<br><br>The <i>Mythic Monsters</i> series from Legendary Games brings you dynamic and exciting mechanics alongside evocative and cinematic new abilities that really help creatures live up to their flavor text, whether they are creatures of real-world myth and legend or creatures born out of the RPG tradition itself. These creatures can work just as well in a non-mythic campaign as they do in one that incorporates the full mythic rules, as you can throw them at your jaded players who think they’ve seen it all or know the standard monster stats as well as you do. That look of surprise and “What was THAT?” will warm any GM’s heart.<br><br><i>Conversion by: </i><strong>Jay Scheponik</strong><br><br>Released on March 05, 2018. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.3.4 and higher.<br><br><strong>Requirements:</strong> An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds Full or Ultimate license and the included Pathfinder ruleset.",
