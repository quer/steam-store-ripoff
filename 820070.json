Currently, only fire staffs are supported.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crafting</h2>Craft a variety of things, like armor, food, building materials, etc. There are a lot of professions and you can craft the basic stuff from all of them, but can master only a few to craft advanced items like modules for your matter manipulator.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Building</h2>Build with smaller blocks than in other voxel games, giving your creativity more freedom.

Most of the content is already defined in XML files, so we will only have to add some logic that loads user-generated XML files and some code for interaction between different mods. Additionally, a Lua API will be added to support more advanced mods.<br>Mods will not only be easy to create, but also easy to install - if you connect to a modded server, you will not even have to manually install mods since this will be done automatically.<br><br><strong>Space stations</strong><br>Feeling lonely in space? No one can hear you scream? Well, then visit one of the space stations and meet with other folks!
