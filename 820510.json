But there’s a twist! <i>(Isn’t there always?)</i> Though you’re from the Witching Realm, where magic is commonplace, you’ll be enrolling at a summer camp for Humans who have long since forgotten that Witchcraft exists. While summering in the Human Realm, you'll have to conceal your identity and make sure not to get caught practicing your craft. Make friends, cast spells, and uncover secrets during your first ever summer away from home. <strong>Welcome to Camp W!</strong><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/820510/extras/welcome_header.png?t=1534880597\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br><strong>Friending Simulator</strong> - Camp W is filled with interesting characters, but everyone can’t be your best friend -- that would be exhausting.
