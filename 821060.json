Think of it as a living Game/Anime/3D-Model Character that overlaps over Windows and other apps.\r\n\r\nFor now we are adding diverse variety character models as mascots with some animations to allow you to relax/fiddle with the mascots to distract yourself from stress and stuff.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nThis is the early access build.  \r\nInteraction/Control is only possible directly when clicking (left mouse button) on the character/mascot.\r\n\r\n1. To change the characters, press and hold mouse button 1 (left click) on the character and press left or right key to toggle through the initially available 4 characters.  \r\n2. To change the animation state of character, just left mouse click on the character itself. \r\nAnimation change is random and sometimes its possible same animation plays, if so, left click again to change to different animation.\r\n3. To change the mascot size, left click on mascot and use mouse scroll wheel to increase or decrease size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=======================\r\n~~Coming Soon: The AI Assistant~~\r\n=======================\r\nFurther down the road, we will be adding AI to it to make it a semi-assistant to perform tasks for a variety of pre-defined things.\r\nWe will be adding character packs of different themes/genres which will allow you a list of things via voice or input command like a Ai assistant would.\r\nWe are looking for more suggestions and input related and unrelated to the AI/Assistant part, what you would like the mascot/character to do, what features you would expect and what particular characters/genres you would like ?
