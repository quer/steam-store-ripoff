Every mechanic within the game is driven by user-defined profiles - Weapons, characters, abilities, bots, how bots dodge, how bots aim, challenges, and more are all configurable by hundreds of variables. All of these profiles can be saved and distributed in a single scenario file. Hone your muscle memory in the trainer, apply it in game.<br><br>Game features:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play scenarios directly from the Steam workshop (30+ before release) to jump right in and practice your FPS skills<br></li><li>Highly responsive input from a tweaked Unreal Engine 4 that has the approval of many top Quake players and Overwatch grand masters who have tested and provided feedback over the last year<br></li><li>All the configuration options you'd expect of a competitive FPS (FOV, separate horizontal/vertical mouse sensitivity, unlocked frame rate, per-weapon config settings, custom crosshairs, and much more)<br></li><li>Create your own weapons<br></li><li>Create your own characters<br></li><li>Create bots<br></li><li>Tell the bots how to dodge<br></li><li>Tell the bots how to aim<br></li><li>Make challenges to practice specific scenarios similar to your favorite FPS<br></li><li>All profiles can be edited in-game or with text editors.<br></li><li>Upload your own creations to the Steam workshop for others to practice.<br></li><li>Compete on the Leaderboards for any and every scenario on the Steam workshop.

As the developer, I consider FPS Aim Trainer a tool that I will be using well into the future. My goal is to keep it relevant to gamers as long as I can. Among my top priorities: advanced movement mechanics such as bunnyhopping and strafe jumping, graph/histogram to look at your scores and accuracies over time, bot types of player-recorded paths, and simulated network lag.<br><br>Running Unreal Engine 4, all graphical options that affect framerate or input lag have been disabled by default. Literally every console command was investigated to see whether any more performance could be eeked out of the engine, because you can never have enough frames per second when you are training for competitive FPSs.
