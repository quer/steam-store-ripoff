Touch a green glow and see its effects. Open a gateway to a new area. Experience new rooms, and descend deeper. Level by level, tap into your gaming intuition to solve each puzzle. Who or what is the &quot;host&quot; and what is your relation to this space?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a focus on experiential-based gameplay, Garrett Fuselier has created a virtual reality to challenge and cherish. The dim glow of the swelling visuals and the fluctuation of the atmospheric audio (all created solely with voice work) build a new kind of gaming experience that, like its narrative, grows in intrigue and innovation. Recalling the classic situation-based puzzles throughout gaming history, you will find no UI, no voice over, and no buttons to press (on your controller).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInside the world of HOST, you are your only salvation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game will stay naturally within the confines of your environment.
