You however will get to download the 3D character to use in this course as a starting point or simply use the character you already built using volume one or your own character. The art student will start by placing the required bones onto a realistic human figure model and learn at the same time how to develop it into an advance rigging system. Riven Phoenix will explain in detail many aspects of rigging step-by-step and show the student how to understand and build an advance knowledge of blender's internal rigging system for human character motion. Students will with this course become very intimate with blender's complex rigging system which they can apply to any 3D character. This course is designed to teach art students how to use blender's rigging system from the ground up and become more confident with it to develop their own rigging systems from scratch. Each step is explained clearly so the student can follow along with ease.<br><br>Blender's rigging system is a very complex subject to understand so Riven Phoenix will explain in detail how to understand and use the rigging system for students who are completely new to this subject.
