And it won’t be easy: Adaptation and exploration will be your main weapons as you craft new items and equipments from your enemies’ carcasses! Every step can be your last one!<br><br>Use your experience points to improve yourself and face what no human has ever faced. After all, quoting David Hume: “The life of man is of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster.” Maybe he was right… Or not.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GAMEPLAY &amp; FEATURES</strong></h2><strong><br>STRATEGIC AND DINAMIC COMBAT</strong><br><br>What’s left to someone put in such a situation?
