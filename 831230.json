But don't worry, I've given you all the tools you need to get out. Well, tool. This isn't a complicated game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, you're in a room, right? And there's a door. You'll recognize it, even though the graphics are so bad that it doesn't look like a door. That's because there is a sign in front of it that says &quot;EXIT&quot; and has an arrow pointing to the previously described door. So you'll just open that and everything will be fine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOH NO, IT'S LOCKED!!! Why would a cruel game developer do this to you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWait a minute, I think I see something on the other side of the room. Multiple somethings, in fact. Maybe one of those things can help...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n- Six things that you can pick up!<br />\r\n- Five Steam Achievements!<br />\r\n- Four original pieces of music!<br />\r\n- Three possible endings!<br />\r\n- Two gratuitous exclamation points!!!<br />\r\n- One fire!<br />\r\n- Zero quality!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo don't be a negative one, play Doors Quest Demo today.
