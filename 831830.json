They may be researchers or writers, spreading ideas to the far corners of the world that plant the seeds of change wherever they are heard or read or understood. They may be naturalists and explorers, insightful observers into the world around them as it exists, or they may be forward-thinking futurists and experimenters always pushing the envelope of the possible.

Equal parts archivist and tinker, from calm loremasters to raving mad scientists, a genius adapts the knowledge of the past and applies it to new situations and new opportunities for breakthroughs. A genius is a character whose mind is her ultimate weapon and who has never met a problem she could not think her way through.
