Amtrak would retire its last SDP40Fs in the early 1980s, but while the service careers of the SDP40Fs on Amtrak were relatively short, the big diesel nonetheless served a historic role for the passenger carrier and endured long enough to wear three Amtrak liveries (Phase I, II, and III), each of which are included in this DLC.
