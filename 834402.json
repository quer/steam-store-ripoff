Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>First appearing in 1926, the DR BR 44 was designed to haul heavy goods over steep gradients, and now you can recreate historic action aboard the “Jumbo”!<br><br>In their early days, relatively few BR 44 steam locomotives were built (only 10 in fact); it wasn’t until the late 1930s that rising demands necessitated a larger fleet of heavy freight locomotives – and the 44 seemed like the best design for the job. Their 2-10-0 wheel arrangement meant they weren’t very fast, but had a high tractive effort, which meant they were able to haul up to 1,200 tonnes at any one time while also working in hilly regions, or 600 tonnes on even steeper rails.<br><br>The BR 44 fleet quickly expanded, and with the onset of the Second World War, hundreds were produced. By the end of their production run in 1949, there were almost 2,000 in service. It was down to their numbers that they became one of the most common sights on heavy freight duties, and such would remain true until the arrival of diesel and electric traction.<br><br>Nicknamed the “Jumbos” by those who worked on them, the DR BR 44 saw European-wide use later in their life with examples transferring to Poland, Austria, France and Czechoslovakia.
