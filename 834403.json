Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>The Class 315 fleet has spent 38 years working both the GEML, the Lea Valley Lines, and occasionally stretching further afield to the likes of Braintree – however their most notable work is the stopping ‘metro’ services between London and Shenfield, a distance of around 20 miles.<br><br>It’s time for you to challenge those 20 miles, shuttling commuters from Essex in and out of East London (including the complex hub that is Stratford station!) for onward travel. Waggonz and Armstrong Powerhouse have done a wonderful job bringing this service into Train Simulator, and they’ve pulled out all the stops…<br><br><strong>New Feature – Guard Operation</strong><br>Class 315s were historically operated by a driver and guard, the latter of which would be in charge of all the door controls – this has been (optionally) replicated here, where upon stopping at a station you no longer need to press T to open the doors, the guard will do it for you.<br><br><strong>Driver Only Operation</strong><br>In recent years the Class 315s have been subject to Driver Only Operation, which gives you full control of the doors’ opening and closing at every passenger stop.<br><br><strong>Wheelslip &amp; Wheelslide Protection</strong><br>When there is poor adhesion, traction can often slip along the rails, the Class 315 automatically protects against this by regulating their power when slipping is detected, it is then best to find a balance between minimal slipping and maximum acceleration.<br><br><strong>CSR &amp; GSM-R</strong><br>Depending on whether you’re driving a mostly original condition or a refurbished Class 315, you will be able to register with CSR or GSM-R as appropriate. This is a vital step to ensure communication between the driver and the signaller, for example you can use each system to bypass using Tab to pass a signal at danger.<br><br><strong>Destination Display</strong><br>In the main pack, the older manual destination blind is featured, and can simply be scrolled through to find the right destination in the list.
