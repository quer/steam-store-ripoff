            "detailed_description": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fly Hard</h2>Acro FS is a stick-and-rudder aerobatic flight simulator. Designed from the ground up to accurately simulate aerobatic flight, it allows you to experience what it’s like to strap into a high-performance stunt plane and take to the sky. There’s no navigation, no radios - just a lot of horsepower in a state-of-the-art aircraft.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">By Aviators, For Gamers</h2>Acro FS is created by Jim Bourke, airshow pilot and member of the US Unlimited Aerobatic Team. You take the controls of “Fuzz Machine”, Jim's modified Extra 330SC. Throttle up, build some speed, and take off to see what you can do with it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Box Is Yours</h2>Take off from Borrego Valley Airport, get some altitude, and dive into the box. Ground markings for the competition box are right where they are at the real-world airport  in California, so you can work on placing your sequence precisely where it needs to be.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Racing</h2>Test your skill against the clock, flying through inflatable pylons or holographic gates. Just be careful - the ground comes up fast!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">VR Support</h2>For a truly immersive experience, use your Oculus, SteamVR, or Windows Mixed Reality headset. Look around the cockpit, check your gauges, or take a glance out the wing to make sure that 45-degree upline is true.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unigine2</h2>Acro FS is built using Unigine2, a cutting-edge large-world game engine. This gives the simulator tremendous realism, whether you’re looking down at the desert from 5000 feet or inspecting the instrument panel up close.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Realistic Flight Model</h2>Under the hood, Acro FS is powered by the FlightAxis physics system. Our predictive model simulates each component of the aircraft and integrates these effects into a total response. Component-based simulation allows Acro FS to model the exotic conditions created by aerobatic flight - there are no “blank spots” in the flight physics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Controller Required!</h2>Acro FS requires a controller to run. For good control, you'll need a 4-axis controller. A gamepad will work, as will &quot;3D&quot; flight sticks that include pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle. You can also use an RC-style controller that places these controls on two axes.<br><br>At the moment, only one controller is supported at a time. You cannot use a separate throttle or rudder pedals that plug in on their own USB port, unfortunately. We plan to add full HOTAS and pedal support as development continues.",
