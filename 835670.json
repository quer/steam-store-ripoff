This is the route by which you reach ultimate victory in a Vampire Coast campaign (please see Objectives above). <br><br><strong>Pirate Coves</strong><br>After a victorious port-settlement battle, Vampire Coast factions may choose a new post-battle option. Instead of taking, sacking or razing the port, the faction may choose to establish a Pirate Cove in the vicinity. These secret sub-settlements can siphon a steady flow of income from the main settlement, and bring other benefits related to any upgrades the player chooses to build in the Cove. The Cove can only be destroyed if the settlement itself is razed. In addition, a competing Vampire Coast faction which conquers the settlement may commandeer the Cove for itself. <br><br><strong>Upgradeable Ships and Building Trees</strong><br>Legendary Lords sail in their own unique ships. Details of these ship are accessed via the Lord in the same fashion as Horde Buildings for Horde Factions, and contain many powerful upgrades for the Lord and his army. This does not make them a standard Horde faction however. Vampire Coast lords may also occupy settlement like any other non-horde faction, and may develop it using the unique new Vampire Coast building tree. In short, they benefit from the best features of both Horde factions and Settled factions.<br><br><strong>Pieces of Eight!</strong><br>Carefully hidden around the world are eight unique golden tokens. Locating each and defeating its powerful guardian army will grant access to the Vampire Coast Regiments of Renown, powerful elite variants of units in the terrifying Vampire Coast roster.<br><br><strong>Treasure Maps</strong><br>Pirates of folklore buried great treasures around the world. As you win battles at land and sea, you may find the treasure maps marking their rough location. Solve the riddles that shroud them, and they can be yours for the taking... <br><br><strong>Unique Rites</strong><br>Vampire Coast factions gain access to four unique new Rites, granting a variety of bonuses. Curse of the Queen’s Cannon, for example, grants access to Queen Bess, a vast, one-off ship’s cannon which fires colossal cannonballs in a high parabolic arc, dealing tremendous area-effect damage and slowing those affected by the shockwave. Another, Curse of the Sea Mist, shrouds all your regions with a clinging maritime miasma, causing attrition to your enemies and granting Vanguard Deployment to your Monster units.<br><br><strong>New battlefields</strong><br>New Island Maps Broaden Total War: WARHAMMER II’s battlefield environments and, for the first time, players may now attack and defend Dark Elf Black Arks in battle, fighting with their assembled land forces on the lofty slopes of these vast seagoing structures.

While assaulting a hidden chamber, powerful glyphs rebounded Harkon’s sorcery, shattering his mind into many warring personalities and severing him from the Winds of Magic. Harkon’s multiple identities now battle for dominance but they have one common goal, to plunder the sacred places of the Lizardmen and use the power of their Slann artefacts to break the curse and heal his damaged mind.<br><br><strong>Count Noctilus</strong><br>Count Noctilus, once known as Nyklaus von Carstein of Sylvania, was drawn to the maelstrom at the heart of the ocean to feast upon its dark magic. He performed a mighty ritual to transport himself, his castle and all his undead minions there to the Galleon’s Graveyard, a mystical place where wrecks and hulks of the seas are drawn. Reborn as Count Noctilus, he raised the shattered remains of sunken warships to form the hull of the Bloody Reaver and ride the waves of the mortal seas once more.<br><br><strong>Aranessa Saltspite</strong><br>Queen of the Tides, Aranessa Saltspite is one of the most respected and feared pirate captains of Sartosa. Some say she is the daughter of the sea god Manann himself and he whispers to her to take control of all the world’s oceans. Now, many a sea-bloated corpse washes up against the Swordfysh’s hull, and so the Vampire first mates breathe unlife into them, creating a vast rabble of loyal crew, ready to serve at Captain Saltspite’s command. As part of the living realm rather than the undead, she commands a human pirate crew known as the Sartosa Free Company, otherwise reluctantly sharing control of the denizens of the Vampire Coast.<br><br><strong>Cylostra Direfin</strong><br>Legend has it that the sea witch Cylostra Direfin was once the favourite court singer of the Bretonnian king. Sent on a voyage across the ocean to sing for the Phoenix King, they were hit by a fierce storm. The madame’s notes turned to screams of fury as the ship sank, and all onboard drowned. Decades later, a Bretonnian galleon of rotten wood and tattered sails can be seen navigating the seas even in the most savage of storms.
