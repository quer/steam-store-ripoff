A reluctant hero may get through with guile and luck with accidental observation, shot in the dark, lucky guess, and right place, right time, but she's equally adept at applying the keen insights of everyday wisdom with common sense, learning by example, trusty tools, and ever practical. A reluctant hero may seem harmless due to abilities like obscurity, cautious, innocent bystander, and I'm getting too old for this, but when disaster looms a reluctant hero may snatch from death, use everything, or declare that's not fair! or you shall be avenged!
