It’s a free-to-play shooter that puts you at the center of battles in space and above the surfaces of colonies across the solar system.<br><br>But it’s not just you and your guns against the world. You have your teammates—outlaw captains like yourself—and a range of ballistic weaponry, Goliath nuclear torpedoes, and long-range Tesla cannons to fill out your earth-shaking arsenal.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/835860/extras/UMG_ModuleDetail_ENGLISH.png?t=1550009911\" ><br><br>Combat in Dreadnought takes place at a deliberate pace, giving you just enough time to react to an ever-changing battlefield.
