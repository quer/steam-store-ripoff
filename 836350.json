The only problem? You've decided to break up with all of them, <i>one by one.</i><br><br><strong>Heartbreak High</strong> is an arcade-style spin on visual novels and dating simulators that asks you to <i>break up</i> with all of your high school sweethearts instead of woo them. A single play-through can be completed in one 20-40 minute sitting, with each break-up featuring a unique branching story path and lovable (or unlovable?) characters for you to crush beneath your feet over and over again. <br><br>If you couldn't already guess, it won't be easy. There's only 40 minutes until the end of the school day, and on top of that you must be careful not to act too cruel, too sexy, too selfish, and more... sometimes you'll have to stay tactful and sympathetic, while other break-ups will call for a somewhat firmer approach.
