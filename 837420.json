It is a minimalist meditative rhythm game. <br><br>Sex is the oldest rhythm game in the world. It is like making music. It is about keeping pace. It is about trying. It is about putting an effort to keep up with someone else.<br><br>Gameplay:<br>You control a penis moving in and out of a vagina. The app allows you to “record” your motion and save it. When you “play” a saved “record”, the vagina will flash in the pattern that you previously recorded. You then have to match the motion of the penis with the in and out pattern of the vagina. The closer you match the pattern, the faster the meter fills up.<br><br>Sexual Communication:<br>The player can record the motion that they want to experience and let their significant others play it. They can show their partners the motions that they want to experience by literally recording them and then having their partners play them.<br><br>Features:<br>The vagina is recreated using concave soft body physics.<br>As you fill up the meter and come close to orgasm, the simulation lights up with various patterns and colors.<br><br>Experiment Successes:<br>The experience created is trippy and interesting. It matches what I envisioned in my head I wanted to make.<br><br>Experiment Failures:<br>There is no gameplay as such. You can play till the meter fills up. The entire gameplay loop lasts for five or so minutes.<br><br>This is a great piece to show people and watch their faces go W-T-F.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NASTY MODE</h2><br>This is the traditional rhythm game mechanic. Time your input to the right rhythm. The audio is sexual. There are achievements and leaderboards. Can you go 100 on 100 for all penetrations?",
