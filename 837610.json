To its enormous credit, it avoids all those pitfalls, and makes an interesting game in the process.”<br>A- – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gaming-age.com/2017/11/mary-skelter-nightmares-review-ps-vita/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gaming Ages</a><br><br>“Mary Skelter is sublime. By turns darkly sensual and horrific, it's also beautiful, ravishing, and backed by truly expert level design and a clean, clever combat system. This game is too different to effectively compare to other dungeon crawlers, but I must say, of all the many games in this genre that I've played, this one will sit with me for a very long time into the future.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2017/09/review-mary-skelter-nightmares-sony.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Digtally Downloaded</a><br><br>“Mary Skelter: Nightmares provides the dungeon crawling experience fans of the genre crave.
