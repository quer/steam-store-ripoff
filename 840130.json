The game supports up to 100 players. Players must fight with whitherever they can find on the island. You can play aggressively by attacking others and rob their items or hiding. The choice is yours. Whoever survivals to be the last lone survivor wins the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Core Gameplay<br />\r\nPlayers have to locate and scavenge their own weapons ( e.g. pistols,  shotguns, assault rifles) , equipment(e.g. Helmet, Vest)  and supplies(e.g. bandages), and defeat every player in a graphically and tactically rich battleground that forces players into a shrinking play zone. Get ready to land, loot, and do whatever it takes to survive and be the last man standing!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Postapocalyptic Battleground<br />\r\nThe battleground is an isolated island that barely has any intact structures left. It consists of towns, abandoned school, hanger, factories, military base etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Zombies<br />\r\nThere are not only human enemies on the island. Zombies are everywhere, Be careful. Remember to avoid them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4. Team Up with friends<br />\r\nSurvive the battle with your friends. Invite and team up with your friends, coordinate your battle plan and set up the perfect ambush. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n5. Top-down view<br />\r\nDifferent from most battle royale games, the game provides another perspective: top-down. We made a lot of improvements based on this concept. To simply the control and the reserve fun of shooter games  at same time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6. Graphics And Audio<br />\r\nVisual experience with rich detail, realistic gameplay effects and a massive HD map for Battle Royale.
