To win the game you need to win 3 rounds. To win a round you need to herd 3 sheep into the central pen and hold them there for 3 seconds. Controls are very simple, point the analogue stick in the direction you want your dog to run and it will follow your command. If you pick up a power up you can trigger it with the action button.<br><br>Will you play defensive and block your opponents? Or will you become top dog by rounding up your sheep in record time using your speed and agility!?<br><br>So go grab your friends and challenge them to some fast and frenzied sheep herding.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Family friendly</h2>Sheep Game is a family friendly game to be enjoyed by young pups and old dogs alike. It is free from any violence or swearing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Best played with friends</h2>Whilst you can play on your own to sharpen your skills, Sheep Game is best played with friends gathered around. Up to four people can play head to head.<br><br>Don't have four controllers? No problem, Sheep Game supports four players using two controllers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simple controls but hard to master</h2>Sheep Game is easy to pick up, you'll have your dog running around in no time, but keeping those sheep under control will take time to master.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Break the deadlock with power ups</h2>Having trouble with your rivals? Use a well timed power up to freeze them in their tracks or give your self a speed boost to tip the balance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to play</h2>Sheep Game requires game controllers, but there is some support for a keyboard.<br><br>Player 1: arrows + enter (action button / join game)<br>Player 2: a (rotate left) d (rotate right) w (move) + s (action button)<br>Player 3: c (rotate left) b (rotate right) g (move) + v (action button)<br>Player 4: j (rotate left) l (rotate right) i (move) + k (action button)",
