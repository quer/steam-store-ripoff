In HAZMAT HIJINKS® you’ll need multicolored hazmat suits for protection as you traverse chemical spills, run through radiation, dodge giant viruses, and battle the Cleaners in your quest to rescue Hanford’s fox.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA SERIOUS GAME FOR GAMERS<br />\r\nHazmat Hijinks doesn't hold your hand! The puzzles have been meticulously designed to build on each other, rewarding you for having creative insights rather than doing tedious work. This is a game that respects your intelligence throughout its 5 worlds and 96 challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCONSOLE QUALITY<br />\r\nIf you spend an average of 15 minutes on each level, you'll enjoy this game for 24 full hours of play and contemplation. The bare minimum time for a long play with zero mistakes is roughly 4 hours. The first world will probably go fairly quickly, but it does get more difficult after that. Fortunately, you can choose multiple pathways through each world, leaving more challenging levels for later. You can complete the game and see the main ending by finishing just 1/3 of the levels, then attack the rest at your leisure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSECRETS &amp; EASTER EGGS<br />\r\nHazmat Hijinks is an ode to the joy of discovery. Every level has something new and surprising. There are dozens of secrets and easter eggs, as well as a special puzzle that can only be completed in the real world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINDIE GAME<br />\r\nHazmat Hijinks was designed and produced entirely by one developer, Tod Powers. It took him over a year and a half to complete his vision.",
