In the aftermath of the pandemic, huge swaths of the world are mostly empty - inhabited by solitary survivors and little else. With this grim landscape as a background, Matthew and Hannah travel together through the desolation, searching for the remainders of Matthew’s family. Their journey takes a horrific turn when Matthew suddenly becomes infected by the disease. They take shelter in the basement of an abandoned farmhouse, and Hannah tends to Matthew as he grows increasingly ill. In the hopes that he can survive the ordeal, Hannah administers a drug she has scavenged. This drug has the potential to be effective against the disease – but it is almost certain to cause madness. Confined to the basement, Matthew descends into insanity as Hannah attempts to care for his rapidly deteriorating body. But the disease isn’t their only foe; a crazed infected woman stalks them outside the house, and Hannah makes a shocking discovery in the adjacent barn. When a mysterious and un-infected stranger appears, promising the key to survival, Hannah is presented with an impossible choice. Forced to act, she takes matters into her own hands, and fights desperately to save Matthew, and herself.",
