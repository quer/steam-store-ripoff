There are over 700 in total, and each one has a unique trait that improves its abilities in battle.<br><br>You can acquire new creatures either by finding them in the wild, or by breeding two of your own creatures to make them lay an egg. For example, you can create a Gula Sin by breeding together a Wyvern Sonicscreecher and an Aaxer Apocalypse.<br><br>Keep your eyes open for ultra-rare &quot;Singular&quot; creatures, which are creatures that have a unique color scheme compared to their normal counterparts.<br><br>Each creature also has its own lore that you can read about in the library. In total, our creature lore contains more than 55,000 words.

There, you'll fight against enemies that can be killed to increase your creatures' experience points, as well as drop resources and items that you can use to further improve your party.<br><br>There are 15 different tilesets for Realms, and each Realm offers exclusive creatures, quests, events, and much more.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/841770/extras/02.png?t=1540995963\" ><br><br>Your creatures can equip items called Spell Gems, which allow them to cast the spells contained in these gems. You can enchant these Spell Gems to add new properties to them which change the way the spell works. For example, you can customize the type of damage the spell does, or cause the spell to activate an additional effect after a creature casts it.<br><br>There are over 300 Spell Gems to find in the game, and over 20 properties that you can add to each spell.

Here's a brief list... and believe it or not, this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Cards</strong> - these rare items have a small chance to drop from enemies after you defeat them. They grant bonuses to you and your creatures just by having them in your inventory. It will take a long time to find all of the 700+ cards in the game!<br></li><li> <strong>Talismans</strong> - these work a lot like Cards in that they provide you with passive bonuses. However, by completing certain end-game content, you can upgrade your Talismans to improve the bonus and even unlock new powers!<br></li><li> <strong>Favor</strong> - There are 15 gods in the game, and you can increase your favor with each one. As you do so, you'll unlock new game features, creatures, items, and more!<br></li><li> <strong>Knowledge</strong> - the more you defeat a certain creature, the more knowledgeable you'll become about it, which unlocks new bonuses when you're fighting against that creature. Eventually, you'll be able to see a creature's health/mana bars in battle, view their lore in the library, deal additional damage to them, gain more experience points and resources by defeating them, and increase their chance to drop their Card.<br></li><li> <strong>Singular Creatures</strong> - each creature in the game has a &quot;Singular&quot; counterpart. Singular Creatures are extremely difficult to find and have a unique color palette.<br></li><li> <strong>Achievements</strong> - the game has hundreds of achievements for you to collect. When you earn an achievement, you'll gain some Achievement Points which improve the quality and quantity of loot you'll find during your travels.<br></li><li> <strong>Wardrobe and Titles</strong> - you can unlock new costumes for your character to wear (such as a chef's uniform), as well as titles that change your name (so you might go from being called &quot;King James&quot; to &quot;James the Drunk&quot;). Wardrobes and titles can be seen by other players when you participate in asynchronous player-versus-player battles.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/841770/extras/05.png?t=1540995963\" ><br><br>Don't you hate when a good game comes to an end? We do too. That's why Siralim 3 never truly ends.<br><br>There's not even a level cap. You can continue leveling your character and creatures forever, all while still finding new challenges waiting for you just around the corner. We've crafted every game mechanic around players who want to someday accumulate hundreds, if not thousands of hours of playtime.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/841770/extras/06.png?t=1540995963\" ><br><br>Completing the game's main story quests is just the beginning. After that, you'll unlock countless new systems to keep you entertained for hundreds of hours to come.<br><br>Here's a brief list of some of the game's end-game content, but again, there's so much more to this game than we can possibly write here.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Itherian Realms</strong> - these work like normal Realms (as we described earlier), except these have randomly generated properties that change the way the enemies or even the Realm itself behaves. You can acquire and upgrade Talismans in Itherian Realms in order to bolster your party. You can even find the elusive Itherian Creatures here, which are rare creatures that have unique traits you won't find anywhere else.<br></li><li> <strong>Tavern Brawls</strong> - fight against other players' creatures in asynchronous player-versus-player combat. You can earn exclusive Spell Gems, creatures, and other items if you win!<br></li><li> <strong>End-Game Quests</strong> - a never-ending supply of quests and missions for you to complete long after you experience the main storyline quests.<br></li><li> <strong>Super Bosses</strong> - we can't spoil what these are or how they work here, but rest assured that you'll face plenty of grueling challenges by fighting these bosses... and you'll be handsomely rewarded if you manage to win.<br></li><li> <strong>Arena</strong> - draft a team of creatures and see how many enemies you can take down before your party is wiped out.<br></li><li> <strong>More is on the way!</strong> We're committed to bringing content updates that include tons of awesome, end-game content after the game launches.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/841770/extras/09.png?t=1540995963\" ><br><br><strong>Q: Do I need to play Siralim or Siralim 2 before playing Siralim 3? Are the stories related in any way?</strong><br>A: Siralim 3 is a completely standalone game, and for that reason, you should have no problems playing it without playing the other games first. While the stories in Siralim 2 and 3 are intertwined, they can still be enjoyed independently. In short, there's something for new and old players alike!<br><br><strong>Q: What's new from Siralim 2?</strong><br>A: We already listed most of the new features elsewhere on this page, but if you're looking for a more concise list, <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://thylacinestudios.com/siralim3/faq.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >check out the FAQ on our website</a>!<br><br><strong>Q: What platforms is Siralim 3 available on?</strong><br>A: It is currently available on Steam(PC/Mac/Linux), Android (Google Play), and iOS; and it will eventually make its way to Playstation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.
