Players will play as designer, engineer, and commander, respectively, and guide their fleets through the ages of steel and nerve.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>-As a player, you will construct your warships in dock, using parts offered by the game. Through careful placing and adjusting the parts, you can shape your warships to anything you like.<br><br>-You can take unfinished/newly finished ships for trials, and see if it is satisfactory. Command your warships and progress through the campaigns to earn rewards!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game History</h2>-The idea of the game came from the unfinished IOS-based BattleshipCraft developed by Phyzios, Japan. In 2017, a group of programmers in China re-created the game using unity3d (in which the later developer of NavalArt played a major role), and re-named Process the Battleship. In determination of delivering the most engaging gameplay with the richest content of the kind, the dev started over and crafted the NavalArt.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2>·Historic Equipment<br><br>·Numerous Campaigns <br>·Under-water View<br>·Real-time Physics Calculation (including the waves)<br>·Various Sea Conditions<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What We Plan to Add</h2>·Submarine &amp; Aircraft Carrier Gameplay<br><br>·More Default Maps<br>·More Armaments (including modern weapons, such as Phalanx and missiles)<br>·Steam-based Multi-player Battles",
