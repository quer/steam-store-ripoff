VR Hero Sentry does however not contain gore elements and killing of enemies and companions are fast and efficient!\r\n\r\nThe player is made aware if he or she is low on healthpoints by subtle color markers on the gameplay interface. These color markers are for perception purposes red - the color of blood."
