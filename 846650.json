A chase proceeds but she is unable to flee and is captured. She is taken to a stoneage community, caged like an animal – their prisoner. Here she meets their depraved leader and space traveller, Olsndot (Ecki Hofmann). He is the only human that she can communicate with, here where ever she is. Tentatively he begins to trust her and finally reveals important information about the Corporation. Julia’s world, as she knows it, is destroyed. \r\nAlekto is a science fiction short film which invokes questions about conspiracy theories and the entire evolution of man. An earthling is kidnapped into space, discovering dimensions that she could have never imagined.",
