You just opened your diner. As the first customers take their seats,  you rush to the kitchen. One customer doesn’t want tomato in his burger, while the other one wants a drink.  Those tables won’t clean up themselves either…  If you take too long, your customers will leave angry and hungry, and you’ll soon go out of business!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">UPGRADE YOUR RESTAURANT</h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/846800/extras/Upgrade_your_restaurant.jpg?t=1549621460\" ><br><br>Start off small, cooking burgers and serving drinks to a few curious customers. By upgrading your restaurant with new recipes, expanding the dining area, hiring staff, and impressing your customers, your diner may quickly become a bustling hot spot. With many different equipment to get and recipe types to learn, can your business earn the coveted 3-star award?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS</h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/846800/extras/Special_costumers.jpg?t=1549621460\" ><br><br>You have your everyday patrons, but special customers with specific quirks and fixations will also visit. You have the construction workers, for instance: they’re always hungry and will order 2 courses. Or the runner, always in a hurry, who usually orders a salad. Keep an eye on any punks or thiefs: they will try to sneak away without paying, or will outright try to rob you! Then you have the divas, hipsters, lumberjacks... it takes all sorts to make a world, as they say!
