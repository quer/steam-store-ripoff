This artifact can grant any wish and each hero has a reason for seeking it out. You arrive at the town of Oakdale where you begin your journey down. Oakdale has four buildings that each provide something. There's the Inn &amp; Pub where you can rest free of charge or recruit an ally to help you on your quest. There's the Magic Shop where you can buy staves or spell scrolls. There's also the Equipment Shop where you can purchase weapons and armor. Finally, there's the General Store, where you can buy potions and other items. In each dungeon floor, you fight through enemies who drop gold and XP upon death, and they also have a chance to drop loot! Some enemies are picked randomly when you encounter them so you may not face the same enemy every time. Some enemies don't respawn but most do.
