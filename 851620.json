He hasn't forgotten his badge.The only thing that can derail an entire weekend of panels, cosplay, and consumerism is the fact that an inter-dimensional war might break out on the con floor! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHelp Jacob make the right choices as he's forced into the position of diplomat between three out of this world super-beings ready to turn the convention floor into a pile of ash. An alien princess from beyond the stars. A master thief from another dimension. And the magical girl protector of earth. The other con-goers might mistake them for just girls in costumes, but all of their lives are at stake. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd this isn't the kind of diplomacy that happens over a table in the conference room. If Jacob wants to save the convention, perhaps the entire planet, he's going to have to romance these super-powered cuties! Enjoy the con, save the world, fall in love. All of that and more in Cosplay Convention Crisis!",
