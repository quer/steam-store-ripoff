The name for this is a &quot;Kinetic Novel&quot; -- a subgenre of Visual Novels. You still click through at your own pace, of course, like any other VN, as well as save, load, and view a backlog of what you've recently read.</strong><br><br>This is a linear story about a teenage boy named Keitaro Soseki from Kagoshima, Japan. It is a Slice-of-Life romance novel with lots of comedy as well. For those familiar with VN genres, most of the story is considered &quot;Iyashikei&quot;, but there is a tragic element as well. There are 20 characters with voice acting and expressions.<br><br>Character list:<br>Keitaro - Main character. Smart, innocent, a little shy.<br>Yuri - Keitaro's younger sister. Bubbly and bright.<br>Haruko - Keitaro's older brother. Sporty and mature...for the most part.<br>Noriyuki - One of Keitaro's best friends. He is obsessed with girls and plays competitive video games for the high school eSports team.<br>Shino - A mature and reserved study-bug with a thing for Yuri.<br>Ayuna - Yuri's best friend. Has an interest in Noriyuki.<br>Kadan, Joji, and Orino - Haruko's friends who play for the school's American football team. Kadan is a giant goofball, literally and figuratively. Joji is his loyal sidekick who constantly fails to prevent him from making a fool of himself. Orino is the wisest of the bunch, often scolding Kadan for his clunky behavior and trying to prevent himself from looking like an idiot in their presence.<br>Mai and Tomomi - Keitaro's parents. They're a warm, simple couple.<br><br>The characters all swap out for a new set in the second part of the story, except for Keitaro who stays present throughout.<br><br>Rinji - Another goofball, extremely animated (without any literal animation, of course). He frequently tries to impress Kasumi.<br>Takeo - Just as obsessed with girls as Noriyuki, but is a little smoother about it.<br>Hana - Keitaro's cousin. She has a passion for spirituality and her head can be in the clouds at times.<br>Aiko - Keitaro's cousin. He is a video game developer and sometimes reminds Keitaro of Noriyuki. He is also a passionate futurist who has complete opposite beliefs from his sister. They bicker easily.<br>Kasumi - Bubbly and kind. She is always smiling or laughing. Despite her excessive cuteness, she is smarter than she looks.<br>Keiko - Keitaro's love interest. Wholesome and sweet. She has significant similarities to Keitaro but also complementary differences that make for a natural progression from friend to lover. She is as confident as he is shy.<br>Tamiko and Michio - Keitaro's aunt and uncle. Tamiko is responsible and protective and Michio is a fun and hearty goof.<br><br>There are a series of adventures in the first part of the novel with Keitaro and his friends/siblings. The second part of the novel progresses into a more developed and committed storyline with much more depth to it.",
