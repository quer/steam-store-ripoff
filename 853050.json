There is no indication of a specific time, or place. It could be everywhere and anywhere. A shabby old cowboy on a horse leaves her six-year-old son “El Hijo” in front of a monastery in the middle of the desert, with the intention that the monks would bring him up and give him an education.

The violence is exchanged with the mischievous, playfulness of a young child.
