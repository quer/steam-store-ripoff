            "reviews": "‚ÄúWhen I first had the pleasure to try this game, I was hooked. I had to save all the Pilcri and get 3 stars for every level. Some levels are straightforward and easy, but some are really hard to figure out and even harder to get 3 stars on. You really have to think and strategize which is something I really enjoy doing. For added replay value, try going for a perfect score. Completing each level in the lowest number of moves is even more of a challenge. Some scores will seem impossible to get, but it's so satisfying when you do get it. Can you save all the Pilcri and beat an existing low score? With more worlds coming, there's plenty more to look forward to and more challenges ahead.
