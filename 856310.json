A narrative told with ideas of nihilism, existentialism, surrealism, solipsism and absurdism. The story plays on these thoughts but also presents some dark world where nothing makes much sense at first glance but as one adapts to it, when it manages to invade you; you begin to see that mostly everything is staged within the game for a reason, a motivation sits behind every image and sentence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut at times those dreams can still affect you if you lay there and really begin to pull them apart and ask why, what was the reason for that? Where did those thoughts come from? What is my subconscious communicating, where are the links to my life?  Now you are studying the dream… and there’s a whole ocean of stuff behind that now, connections, motivations and meanings. This is what I want to achieve in Seul.(Alone) and you mostly ever find yourself studying those areas of your life when you are truly Seul.(Alone).",
