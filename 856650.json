No HUD overlays, no ribbon in the sky to follow, no chase plane views. Fly it the way a pilot would, then watch the TV replay afterwards.<br></li><li>Insanely difficult. It is the <i>&quot;flappy bird&quot;</i> of flight simulation. There is no rookie mode to nurse you around. You will have to practice the turns repeatedly until you are in full control of the airplane.<br></li><li>Accurate simulation of a modern aerobatics plane. <br></li><li>Pure test of pilot skill.

I hope that combined with leaderboards for time and penalties it will foster a community that race each other for the top spot.<br></li><li>Fast stable game-play. Down to the minimum spec, my testers have all managed a guaranteed 60 fps. I feel so strongly about this aspect of gaming, that I will report bad frames as part of your results.
