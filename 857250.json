Instead, players are equipped with an anti-gravity jump that lets them jump onto and run along surfaces and gravitational rivets that draw objects together. The wide applicability of these rivets allow players to employ whatever strategies they come up with. Launch environmental objects at opponents to knock them down or launch your opponents themselves. Use the rivets to keep objective items from other players. In some game modes, players can even rip the panels composing the map.
