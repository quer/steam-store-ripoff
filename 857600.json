You recognize a few of them, but you are not sure. They sit in the room, distant and detached. A screen flickers to life and a strange, illusory story starts and enrapture you and your fellow captives. One and all hold on their breath… Suddenly, you find yourself in the middle of a city you seem to remember from your past. Something isn’t right. To survive in this strange timeline and have a chance to escape, you have to solve all puzzles and defeat the insidious boss lurking behind all this! The situation is dire and dangerous, but you are no longer alone!<br><br><strong>Game features:</strong><br>Online multiplayer mode for nine players: Three people work in a team and three teams total will compete against each other.<br>A suspense game based on real stories: Adapted from seven historical events in Macao with various endings depending on player’s choices.<br>Diversified gameplay: To solve suspenseful puzzles, kill powerful monsters, and survive suspicious mechanisms.<br>Unique worship and burial system: death is not the end, but the beginning of another chapter.<br><br><strong>From the Producer:</strong><br>If I can own only one game in my life, I’ll choose Fight the Horror.<br>Time and again, I often wonder if the Twisted World exists, and I am trapped there permanently with no escape. I wouldn’t meet Death nor would I feel hungry. Besides, I would have all the time in the world with me, and my friends would be in the Twisted World as well. If I could bring only one game with me, which one would it be?<br><br>I think if I brought one, it would have to be a horror game. My friends would be there, but I wouldn’t necessarily want them to watch me play. Just like I wouldn’t want to stand there and watch them play. I hope we could feel the thrill and excitement in the game together, but the game has to be uber scary even though I play with my friends. Smacking zombies could be boring, so I would delight in suspenseful plots. I also love a game that leaves us some room to reflect and review.<br><br>Furthermore, I like to move around when I play a game. To me, a game has to be more than just mashing the mouse, opening the door, even watching an ad… I crave for fascinating upgrades and elements for collection in the game, but I do not necessarily want to pay extra for things all the time. I want to earn them. I hope this is a game that will continue on for a long time. I hope this is a game that can bring us lots of fun no matter when we play it.<br><br>It’s a shame that I haven’t found a game like that, so I hope for the time being, the Twisted World wouldn’t happen to me, yet. When Fight the Horror is out, I will bring this game to there, and make it my paradise!",
