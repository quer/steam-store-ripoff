Track 17 Music for ghosts contains all the themes for the ghosts in the game, even though this track is only heard in snippets here and there, and the ghost’s themes are usually quoted in other tracks instead which are found throughout the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou might wonder why the tracks are named just after places in the game instead of having more evocative poetic names.
