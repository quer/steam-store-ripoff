In this emotional journey, the story explores how war affects ordinary citizens who want to go about their day to day lives, not just the brave soldiers who fight on the front lines. As a train pilot you are tasked to go around the country to help as many people as you can. Will you help the remaining survivors reach their families, help the terminally ill or will you be greedy and make the most out of the dire situation by hoarding all the supplies you get from them?
