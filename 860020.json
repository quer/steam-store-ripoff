There is a small number of fugitives that need to exfiltrate. They can use a map and a GPS to get to the possible exfil points, and set a certain number of traps to cover their back. On their tracks, there is a small number of K-9 units that can use their canines to find the fugitives. The bulk of the chasers is then made up of a military team that works closely with the K-9 units.<br><br>The goal is for players to fill a role and think strategically. I encourage a simulative approach and act as you would do in real life. If you're interested in FPS with a lot of firing action, this game might not be for you. Instead, a creative and realistic approach can offer you simulative real life scenarios.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roles</h2><strong>As a Fugitive</strong><br>You need to complete your goal while staying alive. You will be tracked down so hide in the shadows and lose your tracks. Even better: learn how to use them to ambush the pursuers.<br><br><strong>As a K-9 unit</strong><br>Everyone counts on you and your K-9 to track down the fugitives. Treat your dog as the precious resource they are, and ensure that they don't get harmed. Without them, it'd be almost impossible to find the fugitives in these dense forests.<br><br><strong>As a Military</strong><br>You know what to do, and you know it well. You're the backbone of this chase, and you won't fail.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Access Warning</h2>There currently isn't a dedicated server to play on.
