Largely based on Rogers standard 4-4-0 design (of which one notable example was Union Pacific No. 119), the “Buffalo” was equipped with an extra set of driving wheels, making it a 4-6-0 “Ten-Wheeler” – and a locomotive well-suited to battle the steep grades of Central Pacific’s crossing of California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains.<br><br>CPRR’s Buffalo-class locomotives were wood burners, equipped with balloon smoke stacks housing large spark arrestors made from hardware cloth. Representing “big” power in the late 1860s, the 4-6-0s featured 18” x 24” cylinders, 57-inch drivers (with tires), and produced 13,000+ pounds of tractive effort. With an extra set of driving wheels (as compared to a 4-4-0), the Buffalo-class Ten-Wheelers had less space to fit the valve gear and crosshead pumps, leading to a cramped appearance in the area just behind the cylinders. But nonetheless, dressed out in a vibrant Russia-iron, black, red, and green livery, the husky Ten-Wheelers were handsome steam locomotives.<br><br>The “Buffalo” 4-6-0 will provide everything from the challenges of stoking a wood-burning fire and managing injectors and boiler steam pressure to throttle lag and dealing with authentic wheel slip. With numerous interactive and animated elements, the “Buffalo” is remarkable in its realism. Smokebox provides expert and simple operating modes that make the locomotive accessible and enjoyable for all users. <br><br>Joining Central Pacific No. 82, the “Buffalo,” is sister locomotive CPRR No. 86, the “Gorilla,” as well as two new types of period rolling stock – a CPRR wooden boxcar and caboose-coach. The “Buffalo” pack also features three enjoyable career scenarios set on Smokebox’s captivating and immersive Cheyenne 1869 route (as included in the “Union Pacific No. 119 Steam Loco Add-On” DLC, which is available as a separate purchase).<br><br>The Central Pacific Ten-Wheeler “Buffalo” is now available for Train Simulator – and the classic locomotive will provide countless memorable “Old West” railroading experiences!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>Three captivating career scenarios for the CPRR 4-6-0 on the Smokebox Cheyenne 1869 route are provided (the route is included in the Union Pacific No. 119 Steam Loco Add-On):<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[Buffalo] Boxcars Westward<br></li><li>[Buffalo] Gorilla in the Mist<br></li><li>[Buffalo] Hot Box</li></ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/678005\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Union Pacific No. 119 Steam Loco Add-On</a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.</strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
