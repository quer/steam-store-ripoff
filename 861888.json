Each product is designed to provide education and entertainment for users. Xbox controller and HUD interface support do not come as standard and users will need to read the accompanying documentation to fully understand the operation of this advanced simulation.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Delve into the Great Western once more with the famed and versatile GWR Pannier Tanks!<br><br>In order to adapt to the latest in firebox technology, the Great Western Railway had to alter the design of tank locomotives, switching from “saddle” water tanks to “pannier” water tanks to make everything fit. The change was an all-around success, and eventually led to some of the most prolific locomotive types in British railway history.<br><br>There were several successful iterations of the GWR “Pannier Tanks” – such as the 5400, 6400, 5700 and 7400 classes, all of which are included in the GWR Pannier Tank Pack – the most popular of which was the 5700 fleet, which between itself and all its variants came in at over 850 locomotives strong. These locomotives were used throughout the GWR network on both passenger and freight duties. Meanwhile, other classes such as 5400 and 6400 were fitted for unique “auto-train” operation on lighter passenger duties.<br><br>Despite being no express workers, some GWR Pannier Tank locomotives were able to achieve up to 500,000 miles during their operational lifetime, and multiple examples were some of the last steam locomotives to still be in active service with the National Coal Board, as well as London Transport. Of the plentiful 5700 Class, 16 were preserved with 6 currently operational, meaning visitors of heritage railways can get a taste of the GWR’s finest shunter.<br><br>In Train Simulator, you have the ability to experience the GWR Panniers in incredible, authentic and almost never-ending detail. The different configuration and livery options mean you have access to hundreds upon hundreds of individual locomotives, as they were in each era. If that wasn’t enough, the GWR Panniers are accompanied by the BR-built Hawksworth A38, A39, A40 and A43 autocoaches for varied steam-era push-pull operations.<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>The GWR Pannier Tank Pack features ten challenging career scenarios for multiple routes:<br><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/24096/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Falmouth Branch Route Add-On</a><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Cornish Tea Time, Part 1<br></li><li>Cornish Tea Time, Part 2<br></li><li>The Quay To Success</li></ul><br><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/208294/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Class J94 ‘Memories of Maerdy’ Loco Add-On</a><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>NCB Duties<br></li><li>Ferndale Coal</li></ul><br><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/325960/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Riviera Line in the Fifties: Exeter - Kingswear Route Add-On</a><br> <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Station Pilot<br></li><li>Thanks For All The Fish<br></li><li>Winter Deputy</li></ul><br><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/222615/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >West Somerset Railway Route Add-On</a><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Minehead Sandwich, Part 1<br></li><li>Minehead Sandwich, Part 2</li></ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/24096/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Falmouth Branch Route Add-On</a>, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/24096/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Falmouth Branch Route Add-On</a>, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/208294/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Class J94 ‘Memories of Maerdy’ Loco Add-On</a>, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/325960/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Riviera Line in the Fifties: Exeter - Kingswear Route Add-On</a> and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/222615/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >West Somerset Railway Route Add-On</a> are required, as separate purchases, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.</strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
