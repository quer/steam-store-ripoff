You somehow managed to choose, but the adventure does not end there! You realized that it is useless to fight and you will have to flee.<br />\r\nOn the way you will be waiting for:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- creepy montsers<br />\r\n- steep precipices<br />\r\n- nice bonuses<br />\r\n<br />\r\nand much more!",
