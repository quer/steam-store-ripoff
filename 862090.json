As a new “Cyber Tactical Operations” agent, you must prove yourself in the famous Section 8. No time to wonder why you have been chosen to join the top team of the agency, the danger is everywhere and you need to act fast before it is too late. From Technological havoc to Bio-terrorism, will you be able to stop the attacks and prevent a massive catastrophe? Do you have what it takes to be a Cyber Warrior?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><br><strong>Military Hacking Simulation</strong><br>NT4 is the most realistic hacking simulation to date. You are a Cyber Operation Specialist from a secret military organisation, and you will live like one. You will use military tools to perform your duty, or very similar ones inspired by the notorious “Kali” platform. From Reconnaissance to Exploitation, you will learn the most recent and efficient hacking techniques and become a fearsome hacker.<br><br><strong>High Tech Hacking Platform </strong><br>The Stinger OS is an advanced hacking suite developed by the most brilliant minds of world class technological institutes. More than 20 powerful tools are at your disposal to accomplish your tasks and help you during your journey. But the Stinger OS is a living piece of software always updated and fine tuned. Who knows what else will be added to this technological marvel.  <br><br><strong>An Immersive Realistic Story</strong><br>NT4 is often called at the last resort to solve impossible problems and address tremendous issues. This time you are needed to identify and neutralize a world level threat. While you are sweating your shirt working against the clock to save the world, two questions are haunting your nights… why you? And how does this all thing seems so familiar to you?<br><br><strong>Coop and Community Challenges</strong><br>NT4 is also a community game. Every mission is playable with your friends. A team of 4 is more efficient than a solo hacker, no matter how good they are. Share your files and resources with your friends and together nothing will stop your momentum. The best hackers create the best trials. Compete with all the community through the “Hive Mind”, overcome the most difficult challenges, and show them how a skilled hacker you are.",
