No, not a world of fantasy or a faraway land. I can show you a place where the ethics and restraints of social rules do not apply.

It passes aimlessly. Why? Because only we, humans, perceive it this way. But here… here it has a life of its own, it creates its unique world. A place where time is only a moving image of the surroundings.
