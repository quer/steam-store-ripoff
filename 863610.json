Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years.<br><br>While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before.
