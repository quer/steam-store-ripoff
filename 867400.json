The gameplay system is so designed as to give you best of random loot placement and adaptive objectives. Together with a dynamically adjusted map for the given amount of players and weather affected sailing, the raids will always stay challenging, keep you in the eye of the storm and the pace as high as possible.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vessels</h2>Set your crew's sails, add equipment, do the paint job but don't forget to choose the proper ship class for your raid plan. Pirates need to take into account several variables before sailing into a battleground such as map size, islands placement, weather, personal crew style. Galleon-size ship that's perfect for a tight crew might not be the best idea for a lonewolf.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Weaponry</h2> Enjoy variety of firearms to find and upgrades to attach, starting from a flintlock pistols and 4 barrel revolvers all the way up to revolving rifles and hand cannons - everything that properly prepared pirate would need to deal with opponents and still find fun in it. Those who need bigger calibers should invest in cannons and mortars to mount on their ships.
