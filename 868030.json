            "detailed_description": "This is the demo version of the game HexTrains, so that you can check out if you like it. You can play the first five maps and online leaderboards and achievements are also enabled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHexTrains mixes the classic tower defense with the puzzle genre. You need to destroy colored cargo containers that are transported by trains while building turrets that match the respective colors. Additionally you can manipulate switches to control the movement direction of the trains, which lets you guide the freight to the matching turrets. To make it easier to deal with the oncoming flood of trains you can also upgrade your turrets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game offers you 58 levels, each usually playable multiple times with different cargo and turret configurations. This currently results in a total of 139 unique, playable versions. These can all be unlocked by playing the game and no additional in-game purchases are necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose from 4 levels of difficulty to adjust the game speed to your needs. The difficulty level can be changed any time, but you need to keep the challenge high in order to be awarded with the most precious medals and achievements.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe games level browser provides you with easy access to all levels. Also your high scores and awarded medals are displayed there so that you have an overview of your performance for each each level / version so far.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the game was initially developed for smaller screens, you can play HexTrains on a desktop monitor in windowed mode with resolutions including 1440x810, 1366x768, 1280x720 and 1136x640.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you get stuck on a map and need help, we offer you access to solution proposals for each map on our website.",
