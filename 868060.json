            "detailed_description": "Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics, slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/868060/extras/Immortal_Darkness_Strategy.jpg?t=1545285719\" ><br><br>The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. <br><br>You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself.<br><br><strong>Fools Rush In</strong><br><br>This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/868060/extras/Immortal_Darkness_Spells.jpg?t=1545285719\" ><br><br><strong>The Thirst</strong><br><br>As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/868060/extras/Blood_Drink_crop.jpg?t=1545285719\" ><br><br><strong>Items are Everything</strong><br><br>With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play and what you can do.<br><br><strong>Secrets Within Secrets</strong><br><br>Few will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon. Evil has been at work here since ancient antiquity and there is more concealed in this place of eternal gloom than anywhere else in Uuld.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/868060/extras/Immortal_Darkness_Secret.jpg?t=1545285719\" ><br><br><strong>Decisions that Will Shape the Cosmos</strong><br><br>There are many factions at play here and who you decide to ally with and who you decide to oppose has the power to dramatically reshape your story and the fate of this world, and possibly many others.",
