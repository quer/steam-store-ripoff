            "detailed_description": "Songbringer's original soundtrack features music created by the solo developer, Wizard_fu. These are 100% original compositions created specifically for the game and adapted into soundtrack form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a gapless album. One song flows into the next to create a seamless, coherent whole. As such, it plays best start to finish rather than being shuffled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFun fact. The game actually has all music in procedural form. The rhythms remain constant yet the melody can change slightly depending on your world seed and dungeon number. For example, world seed PEANUT might have a dungeon 1 in the key of A while world seed YELLOW might have it in the key of C#. Additionally, the game's music is adaptive, so when there are more enemies on screen the music gets more intense by adding layers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a way, this soundtrack is like a snapshot of Songbringer's procedural music content. It starts with the first song in the key of F# then using harmonic mixing takes steps of five to arrive at the next song in the key of C#. Thus the circle of fifths is used to lend the soundtrack a sense of cohesion and continuity. Note that some of the original songs have been split into multiple tracks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n23 tracks, 50 minutes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can play the soundtrack with the Steam Music Player.
