ARC Savior is a top end space shooter that resembles the likes of Mass Effect, Star Fox &amp; Star Citizen all mixed into one mega space fighting experience. With its customizable ship and weapons options to its huge open battleground,  ARC Savior really hits the nail on the head in bringing a great immersive experience. I would highly recommend this title as one to watch for those who, like myself, have a great love for space shooting related games.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.thesoundarchitect.co.uk/dublin-games-festival-2018-event-audio-picks/?fbclid=IwAR3l_DhI1Rci9QB93yM4bkSxJiAk-pqFGazkuuN2Sv5wTTwJzb8Lykfvh-E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Sound Architect UK</a><br><br>“Arc Savior is amongst the most impressive single person projects I’ve seen in gaming.
