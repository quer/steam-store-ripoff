The Professor is a specialist in ranged combat, with less Health and a special shield granted by his weapon, the Tillinghast. The Witch does a lot of damage, has teleport abilities and elemental shields of fire and ice, but also a very low Health. The Thief is a specialist in melée combat that takes advantage of its stealth to maximize her damage. The ghoul does a lot of melée damage, has a high Health and regenerates itself, but can’t use medkits at all.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE GREAT OLD ONES</strong></h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/871420/extras/LUT-WITCH.gif?t=1549992134\" ><br><br>The truth of the dark horrors that inhabit the universe is unbearable for any human mind.
