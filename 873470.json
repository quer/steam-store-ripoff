            "detailed_description": "Zero Sum Future is about turning a fledgling colony into an economic engine that can withstand anything. Build up different industries, supply colonists with goods, and use dirty tactics in a frantic bid to be the last colony standing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build Your Colony</h2>Start in an untouched solar system and build up the infrastructure your colony needs to survive, like food, housing, and power. Once you provide for your colonists' basic needs, you can turn your attention to more lucrative, high-tech industries. Be on the lookout for competing colonies, though – their growth comes at your expense.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Expand Across the Entire Solar System</h2>Every planet that you see you can build on, but real estate is first come first serve. Fill up desolate planets with valuable industries, or take the fight to your opposition, contesting industries on their home planet and disrupting their income streams.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deceive Your Opponents</h2>In Zero Sum Future, you have a wide variety of Illegal Buildings at your disposal. These look exactly like a legal counterpart, but have a different, supercharged effect. However, if an opponent Investigates your illegal activity, you will lose your ill-gotten gains and suffer a financial penalty.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Muscle Out the Competition</h2>Take over buildings, monopolize a planet's consumers, brainwash colonists, or steal shipments of goods. These are just a few of your options for disrupting an enemy's operations.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive</h2>While defending against increasingly aggressive opposition, you will also have to contend with colonists demanding a better standard of living, a central government levying massive taxes, and the demands of managing your multi-planet empire. Do you have what it takes to bring it all home in a zero-sum race for riches?",
