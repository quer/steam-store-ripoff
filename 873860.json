You put yourself in a penguin' shoes and your team is counting on you.

You will swim inside an infinity pool, trying to collect coins to increase your score. The game has one control only, touch to jump. The longer you tap, the higher your fish/ shark will jump. You need to avoid hitting the building by jumping through it.<br></li><li>Five Minutes Before (1-2 players). You only have, you guessed it, five minutes to save the lives of those you see on rooftops as you pilot your futuristic aircraft. You will fly your powerful craft gliding between buildings, plunging towards the ground, and then swooping back up on your extreme mission!<br></li><li>One Shot (2 players) FPS.
