Experience thrills, chills, and perhaps even a little something extra as you swim the murky waters of troll romance. Bet you didn’t see that coming, huh? Romance, in a friendship simulator? Unheard of. People don’t romance their friends, that’s crazy talk. <br><br>Though it might not be what you’d expect—this romance you weren’t expecting, that is. So it might just be what you expected after all. <br>Sufficiently confused? Good. Throw down that dollar and allow us to explain.<br><br>---<br><br>You just crash-landed on Alternia, and you’re <strong>DESPERATE</strong> for friendship! Anyone will do...wait, who are those two trolls approaching you?<br><br>The <i>Hiveswap Friendsim</i> is a quick, loosely-canonical visual novel adventure following the efforts of the unnamed protagonist (that’s you!) to survive and maybe even thrive on the harsh surface of ALTERNIA. Set in the time of <i>Hiveswap: Act 1</i>, this episodic visual novel’s opening volume, written by <i>Homestuck</i> creator <strong>Andrew Hussie</strong>, is sure to satisfy <i>Homestuck</i> and <i>Hiveswap</i> fans who are eager for a darker stroll across the Alternian landscape. <br><br>Future episodes will arrive regularly as DLC.",
