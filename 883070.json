Confused... You wake to find yourself in a hospital bed. Something happened... Something at Neuville Mansion that affected you and your friends... You must remember!<br><br>Diving into the murky and muddled memories of your past as you are sucked into an immersive exploration-horror experience. Unravel the mysteries and forgotten events of a place haunted and consumed by secrets, as you find mysterious documents that only hint at its tragic and macabre past...<br><br>There is No Map and No Help. Just you, your alchemical lamp... and… “something” else...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Multiple Endings</h2><br>Completing this game can offer one of three different endings.<br><br>The 'best' one, the &quot;GOOD&quot; ending, is not the norm - it is the exception. It is a reward for players who think differently, explore every shadow and mystery, and for those who have the guile and wit to achieve it… Good luck!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Challenging Puzzles</h2><br>Facing challenging, ingenious, and unique puzzles with no obvious and simplistic answers, you will need to use all the clues the environment provides to find the hidden answer.<br><br>Do not give up! In adversity, you shall persevere!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Items and Inventory</h2><br>Find and use a diverse and creative assortment of items in order to progress through the adventure. A well designed inventory keeps your belongings carefully sorted and provides descriptions that, in some cases, even hide clues...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Interconnected Game Systems</h2><br>With interconnected systems that provide multiple layers of depth and challenge to your gameplay experience, the “Thing” can appear anywhere, and at anytime. Yes, you can try to run... but for how long? Will you switch off your lamp and use the shadows and natural light to your advantage? Or will you cling to your torch's embers to fend off the darkness? Will “It” detect you if you stand but an inch away in total stillness? You hear its footsteps approach… What will you do?!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Original and Breathtaking Audio-Visuals</h2><br>This 100% originally designed adventure is presented with high quality 16-bit pixel art visuals. A labor of love created by a single artist, there is a fully unique and explorable mansion – With no two rooms the same and each individually designed with its own identity.<br><br>Every pixel, every detail, every crack in the wall has been intentionally placed and designed by hand meticulously to tell players a story using no words. Our outstanding 90’s visuals are enhanced by lighting effects, disturbing 3D positional audio, and a completely original atmospheric soundtrack.",
