You’re a cyborg at the wheel of an indestructible vehicle fueled by his own rage. You’re on the grid of a short track, surrounded by walls, the race is about to start. I mean, you know that it’s not a race, but you still want to be in the lead, you can’t help it, it hurts you when you’re not, truly. And since it’s a fight, you should probably try to hurt your opponent’s more than you hurt yourself. Hit them, make them rage, smash them against walls or obstacles, knock them out.
