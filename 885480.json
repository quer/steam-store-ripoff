            "detailed_description": "Maze Crusher is a game originating from Ludum Dare 42 Game Jam.<br><br>You are Kurisou, the little dragon :) - trapped in a huge and creepy maze. You need to find a way out of the maze as fast as you can. You have a limited amount of time to get out. The quicker you are, the more score you get.<br><br>Sounds simple so far huh?<br>Of course there is more! Depending on the maze you play, there will be traps, portals and other stuff. You might need to activate triggers in different parts of the maze to open the exit-portal and you will encounter enemies all over the maze.<br><br>If an enemy gets too near you will attack him which destroys a part of the maze. Unfortunately Kurisou is a young and shy dragon unable to fly so you cant get over destroyed walls! Beware! Do not destroy and block your last way out!<br><br>Also this game features a level editor which allows you to build your own mazes.<br><br>There will further be three multiplayer modes available:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Time-Versus<br>In Time-Versus both players will play the same maze with same enemy waves spawning automatically over time at the same locations. So both will have the exact same game. Winner is, who get through the exit first.<br></li><li>Attack-Mode<br>In Attack-Mode you will both play the same maze again but this time you will have some gold to pay the god of maze (LUL). You can send enemies to your opponent (which costs gold - obviously) as well as cause other chaotic things to happen. Your gold income will increase over time.<br></li><li>Capture the flag<br>In this mode you need to find a way to your opponent's spawn point, grab his flag and bring it back to your spawn. But beware! You mightm lose the flag if you don't watch out.</li></ul><br>We are giving away Pre-Release BETA Keys from time to time on out social media channels:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/firesplashtv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >https://www.twitter.com/firesplashtv</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.twitch.tv/firesplashtv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://www.twitch.tv/firesplashtv</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/firesplash.de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://www.facebook.com/firesplash.de</a></li></ul><i>Note: BTEA-Keys are only valid during until release.
