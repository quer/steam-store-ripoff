Fummy-san absolutely has that mastery and as silly as it sounds, I’ve never had so much fun dying a lot in a video game.<br><br>I was ecstatic to find out that not only is there a remaster of my favorite indie horror classic, but that DANGEN could help to get that game in front of fans that I know will love it.
