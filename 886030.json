Set against the backdrop of an unforgiving, neon-lit dystopian warzone, your only battle is the fight for survival, scraping out a living in the face of extreme danger as war engulfs the world around you.<br><br>You will guide a band of orphans, each with their own skills, emotions, strengths, weaknesses and fears, through a dangerous and ever-changing city in a bitter struggle for survival. Constantly balancing risk and reward, you must make the big decisions to ensure the group stays alive.
