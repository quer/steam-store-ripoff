Dock your fighter to the larger Corvettes and take control of them: decide how to upgrade and repair their subsystems and move them on the battlefield. Will you go for a full-on attack on the enemy cargos to cut off their supply lines, or will you make sure to defend yours first? Will you gamble your Corvette’s hull against the enemy Mothership’s defensive turrets, or will you patiently wait for your fighters to take them down before zeroing in for the final blow? Will your be the rogue dogfight ace, the perfect repair support, the Cargo escort, the brave Mothership bomber, the decisive Corvette mastermind? Your call.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>DOGFIGHT</u></strong></h2>Step into the cockpit of your favourite fighter, strategically pick your loadout and get your weapons hot. From assaulting mighty Corvettes, to escorting Cargo ships, shaking combat drones off your tail, engaging furious 1on1 space duels, infiltrating colossal Motherships and destroying them from within: coming with the Redout Hyper-Adrenaline Seal-of-Quality, it's time to challenge your dexterity through another, even more demanding adventure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><u>BORN MULTIPLAYER, FEATURING A STORY MODE</u></strong></h2>A singleplayer Campaign will allow you to experience the struggles of humanity during these dark days, growing in ranks from simple recruit to the best fighter pilot of the Solar System.

Frantic research has been conducted in the last 150 years. Brave scientists and colonists have taken off towards inhospitable new worlds, often on one-way journeys, to build a new home for humanity. Now, tales of lush green landscapes, rivers and abundant resources run through the void on radio messages, from the Moon to Mars.
