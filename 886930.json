Friends, comrades, a modicum of sympathy in this deep, dark world. They also say you should be careful what you wish for. Desires give way to pain, disillusionment, failure. <br><br>They also say… that you can’t always get what you want. <br><br>But what the hell do “they” know? Who are “they,&quot; anyway? Some faceless, nameless creature of void and existential scare quotes? They don’t know you. They don’t know your life. They don’t understand the delectable sweetness of a fresh scoop of friendship on a hot day. They can’t comprehend the sensual thrill of a brand-new volume of the Hiveswap Friendsim. They are a stranger to the myriad delights of expecting two new trolls, but instead finding yourself rewarded with three just because the universe is so good and kind and ready to pour blessings upon you. <br><br>So forget about them. Come hang out with us. We got you.<br><br>---<br><br>You just crash-landed on Alternia, and you’re <strong>DESPERATE</strong> for friendship! Anyone will do...wait, who are those two trolls approaching you?<br><br>The <i>Hiveswap Friendsim</i> is a quick, loosely-canonical visual novel adventure following the efforts of the unnamed protagonist (that’s you!) to survive and maybe even thrive on the harsh surface of ALTERNIA. Set in the time of <i>Hiveswap: Act 1</i>, this episodic visual novel’s opening volume, written by <i>Homestuck</i> creator <strong>Andrew Hussie</strong>, is sure to satisfy <i>Homestuck</i> and <i>Hiveswap</i> fans who are eager for a darker stroll across the Alternian landscape. <br><br>Future episodes will arrive regularly as DLC.",
