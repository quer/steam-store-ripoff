His name was Roman. One day he saw a deep tunnel in the ground. With full curiosity he jumped into the tunnel and found a diamond. He was so excited about the shiny diamond that he just took it and went deeper and deeper, hoping to find more diamonds. After a while he found what he was looking for, but then a creepy red monster came towards him. He did not know what to do, after all, he never learned to fight and was helpless. After a moment of thinking, he took all his courage and jumped with his full strength over the red monster. He was able to escape successfully with his diamonds. When he picked up his tenth diamond, suddenly a large gate opened. It was the exit where Roman came home. He was able to keep living his life peacefully. The end.",
