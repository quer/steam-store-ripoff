What will drive your personal designs? People or profit? Protection or mining?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Engaging campaign</h2>As the Empire's governance troubleshooter, you move from station to station, system to system, picking up where understaffed or negligent Commanders have problems with their stations that need fixing. Get resources supplied where they’re needed, cull unneeded expansions and ensure a sustainable supply of materials before you warp to the next station.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique upgrades</h2>Upgrades to your station happen organically through proximity. Grouping together 3 power plants in a cluster will supply a larger area with power and require less maintenance, as well as linking together their structural integrity. Design your own unique station designs by exploring the variety of different upgrades and the impact they each have.",
