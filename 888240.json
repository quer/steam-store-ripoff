Some of the best tracks are the slower ones however, like the intensely beautiful ”twin” tracks ”The Imminent” and ”The Eminent”. The synthwave ending track ”The Creator” also fits in this category.”<br>7/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.releasemagazine.net/reviews/front-line-assembly-warmech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Release Magazine</a><br><br>“It follows an atmospheric odyssey through a lot of dark ambient , creaky post- industrial , EBM, merely hinted aggrotech, trance and a pinch of pop.
