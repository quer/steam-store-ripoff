            "detailed_description": "ANOTHER SIGHT is a surreal fantasy adventure with steampunk elements set in London in 1899, towards the end of the Victorian era. With an emphasis on culture and character, ANOTHER SIGHT focuses on the emotional development of the relationship between its two protagonists, Kit, a refreshingly intrepid teenager, and Hodge – a mysterious red-furred cat. They meet in the darkness of a London Underground construction site, after Kit loses her sight when the tunnel she had been exploring collapses. They team up for an adventure into the unexpected, with Hodge proving himself to be an indispensable companion, upon whom Kit will come to rely. Kit and Hodge explore a surreal fantasy world, both together and separately, each using their own unique talents to make their way through compelling environments, and to solve intriguing puzzles. Beneath London, in a world inspired by Neil Gaiman’s urban fantasy, Neverwhere, Kit and Hodge encounter a hidden society made up of the world’s greatest inventors and finest artistic minds, including Claude Monet, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison and other historical cultural icons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Another Sight Gameplay Features:</h2><br><strong>AN EMOTIVE ADVENTURE</strong> – A story about a girl and her cat companion on a journey beyond sight and the real world. A tale of affection and intrigue is woven throughout the adventure, touching on trust and companionship, and the consequences of losing what we take for granted. The innovative gameplay and emotional story are galvanized through a soundscape brought to life by a symphonic orchestra, emphasizing the most memorable moments on Kit and Hodge's emotional and physical journey.<br><br><strong>MASTERS FROM THE PAST</strong> - Throughout their journey, Kit and Hodge will meet celebrated virtuosos such as Claude Monet and other historical cultural figures, and learn more about the world and the dangers it presents. These encounters have a visual impact on the world, as Kit's perception alters according to the aesthetics of each famous character's creative movement.<br><br><strong>NARRATIVE-DRIVEN GAMEPLAY</strong> – Use the unique abilities of each character to help Kit and Hodge traverse the world and overcome environmental challenges. Kit and Hodge can split up to investigate different areas of the locale that the other may not be able to reach, with both Kit and Hodge perceiving the world in very different ways, opening up different possibilities for overcoming the obstacles they are faced with on their adventure.",
