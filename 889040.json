The flight model has been made accessible to users via an array of variables and parameters which pilots are free to tune and tweak. This allows pilots to match perfectly the expected performance. No other sim allows users to alter the physics of the flight model in such depth and magnitude<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Best possible performance on low-end machines</h2>The sim has been tested and runs with a steady framerate on a US$200 laptop!
