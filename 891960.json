The James Webb Space Telescope and its infrared-light perception of the cosmos are simulated using NASA data, along with bonus information and interactive learning experiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can visit the James Webb Space Telescope at its orbit point beyond the Moon, 1 million miles from Earth, set against an accurate backdrop of the Solar System. Fly up-close to Webb’s beautiful golden mirrors, and look out from its perspective on the universe. You can also compare Webb with the Hubble and WFIRST space telescopes. Info hubs within the VR environment provide more information about each mission.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurther out, explore your own cosmic neighborhood—the Solar System—in gorgeous detail.<br />\r\nFly through Saturn’s rings or join Jupiter’s moons in orbit around the gas giant. You may also leave the Solar System behind and visit the stunning Orion Nebula, where a swirling disk of gas and dust is beginning to form planets, or fly through the star fields of a simulated galaxy.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you’re more the hands-on type, try building your own planet or even a whole solar system. Send stars into a black hole and see what happens. See how changing the mass of a star alters the course of its lifecycle. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe awe-inspiring WebbVR environment puts users in the midst of science concepts, presenting realistic, data-based collision physics, Newtonian gravity, gas viscosity, and the electromagnetic spectrum in a new, accessible way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWebbVR is developed in partnership with Northrop Grumman.",
