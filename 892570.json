We thought it was time to let you see things from the perspective of the forgotten: The man (or woman) who made all the tales of great adventure possible in the first place! Of course you won’t be just standing around waiting for adventurers to arrive. You will be managing your own adventurer’s hub as the quest giver in this quest giving simulation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How does that work?</h2>The Quest Giver is a 2D fantasy management game and works much like a point and click game. You click on objects to interact with them or to switch menus or scenes. Most of the actions you can do cost you AP (action points). You have a set amount of AP per (ingame) day that you can spend freely. You can end the day, or your turn, whenever you like.
