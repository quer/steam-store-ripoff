Push your skills to the limit as you attempt to achieve the highest score possible, with intuitive yet deep mechanics that change for each character.

Bring a friend along with drop-in/drop-out co-op to make saving the galaxy from eternal despair a bit easier and a lot more fun!  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNewcomers to the bullet hell genre need not despair, as Astral Gunners aims to ease players into the challenge.  Once you've mastered the six levels inside and out, players can begin to master the scoring system and achieve scores well over 1-million points.  Destroy enemies to build up your special meter, then clear enemy bullets to increase your multiplier, then build up your multiplier high enough to unlock overload mode to collect hidden medallions, all while dodging an endless sea of bullets.",
