This short ranged melee blade will hack and prune anyone dumb enough to get too close up and personal. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPistol <br />\r\nYou spawn with it. The long range and moderate firing rate will allow you to pick off enemies at both medium and long distances, providing they don't overtake you with heavier firepower. Secondary fire uses ice charges which are able to temporary freeze opponents, bogging them down. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nShotgun <br />\r\nThe pump action shotgun inflicts considerable damage at close range. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDouble Shotgun <br />\r\nSlower than the pump action shotgun but twice as deadly at close range. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAssault Rifle <br />\r\nA special hybrid automatic rifle which peppers foes with 16mm rounds even at long range without ever having the need to reload. Lethal if you have an accurate aim. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nShredder <br />\r\nThis unique and nasty tool fires a pair of circular blades in quick succession. You can ricochet them off walls and slice foes who are out of your line of sight. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRocket Launcher <br />\r\nBlow stuff up. Solve problems. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrenade Launcher <br />\r\nThis particular model is able to detonate your grenades at any given moment by using secondary fire. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaser Prism <br />\r\nThe electric beam is able to harm targets at medium range. Your accuracy will determine the outcome of the fight. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlasma Cannon <br />\r\nDesigned to sweep large areas with plasma projectiles. You'll need to properly predict the enemies movement in order to get the best out of this weapon. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nGas Rifle <br />\r\nThis thing spews foulness all over the place. Good for crowd control. The low damage is heavily compensated by the large area of effect. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrossbow <br />\r\nPrimary fire shoots deadly bolts at high speed. Secondary fire also consumes electricity ammo but allows higher range and damage by using electrified arrows.",
