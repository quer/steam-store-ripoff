You will find that the feeling from playing them is EPIC! In a real band, you would usually play just one instrument and you would have to spend years learning it. In Beat the Song you only have to learn for a few hours (yes, it will seem difficult at first, if you’ve never played a similar game) and you will find that you can “play” any instrument and a different one at any moment! It’s an incredible feeling that you have to experience yourself.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">You are the one who will discover the beauty of music</h2>Should you hear the songs from this game on radio or play them on the internet, you would probably pass them without noticing. As with 99% of the others.

Maybe it can’t even be described. You have to learn it and play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Difficulty</h2>Does the game seem too hard? Try different songs at easy difficulty. Even that is sometimes a bit easier or harder. The right feeling comes with medium difficulty and up.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Full length songs</h2>Most of the songs are unabridged. You have heard it - “it should be shortened to not be boring, the right song must have such and such length”... No. Why shorten a great experience? Yes, it would be a lot less work to just use shortened versions, but surprisingly with full unabridged songs you won’t get bored and won’t even notice that instead of 30 seconds you play 5 minutes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to play?</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/894340/extras/howToPlaySmall.png?t=1538757819\" >",
