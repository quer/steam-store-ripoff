The main goal of its development was increasing the G-6’s firepower. The small caliber machine guns mounted in the fuselage were replaced with 13mm MG 131 guns and the U4 variant was equipped with a 30mm MK 108 cannon fitted into the engine cylinder block. The Bf 109 G-6 remained in production for more than a year and many more improvements were devised during its production run. These improvements included different engines, auxiliary systems and armament. The G-6 played a major role in middle and late war aerial engagements over Eastern and Western fronts, above the Mediterranean and in Reich air defense actions.
