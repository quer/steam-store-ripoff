            "detailed_description": "In spite of a long and hard development before going into mass production, this model was a success for the Lavochkin design bureau and an important step on the road to the best Soviet fighter designs of WWII. The La-5FN began its front-line service during Summer 1943 in the central part of the Eastern front. The La-5FN made a sizable contribution in the fight for air superiority. The main improvements compared to the previous design were: boosted M-82FN engine with direct fuel injection, 180 HP more powerful than the previous engine (1850 HP in boosted mode) and many changes to improve the aerodynamics including a bubble canopy and lowered rear fuselage. Front and rear armored glass sheets protecting the pilot’s head were also installed. The La-5FN was used by many famous Soviet air regiments and many famous pilots, including the most successful Allied ace, triple Hero of the Soviet Union Ivan Kozhedub.<br><br>In addition to Quick Mission Builder and Multiplayer modes, you can fly it in Career mode during <strong>Battle of Kuban</strong> timeframe.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/894720/extras/la5fn.png?t=1531482095\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Default armament: two 20mm guns &quot;SsVAK&quot;, 170 rounds per gun, rate of fire 800 rounds per minute.<br></li><li>Length: 8.672 m<br></li><li>Wingspan: 9.8 m<br></li><li>Wing surface: 17.51 m^2</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Modifications</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Loadout variants: armor piercing (AP) or high-explosive (HE) rounds only.<br></li><li>Two 50 kg general purpose bombs &quot;FAB-50sv&quot; (120 kg weight increase with bomb racks, 20 kph speed loss, 12 kph speed loss after drop).<br></li><li>Two 104 kg general purpose bombs &quot;FAB-100M&quot; (228 kg weight increase with bomb racks, 27 kph speed loss, 12 kph speed loss after drop).<br></li><li>Landing light for night flights (2 kg weight increase, minor speed loss).<br></li><li>Fixed loop radio compass RPK-10 (10 kg weight increase, minor speed loss).<br></li><li>Rearview mirror (1 kg weight increase, minor speed loss).</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Skins</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Standard paint scheme (early).<br></li><li>La-5FN produced from the end of Summer 1943 onwards, painted standard camouflage according to NKAP-43.<br></li><li>La-5FN (board number 57) of the 1st squadron of 32 GIAP, one of the very first 12-aircraft series of La-5FN, during the front-line Summer 1943 test at the northern part of the Kursk Bulge.<br></li><li>On this La-5FN (number 25) 2 GIAP Guards Captain Mayorov fought on the 1st Baltic front during Autumn and Winter 1943-44.
