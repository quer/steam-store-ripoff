Explore the vast expanse but be warned, the further you travel from home the greater the danger.<br><br>Your journey begins as an adventurous miner hunting rare resources in the depths of Fringe Space. Become a master crafter of high-tech modules, equipment, starships, or even a fully player-owned station. Perhaps you'll focus your attention on supporting the growth of the Galactic Federation by transporting consumer goods, resources, colonists, and workers to new outposts, earning valuable credit. Or you could armor and equip your starship to hunt for pirates and other treasures in dangerous and unsettled space. Keen on building a business empire? Then dominate the markets by buying, selling, and trading valuable goods from around the cosmos. The choice is yours...

Modules can add or upgrade existing ship functionality from shields and weapons to FTL drives. <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895040/extras/CSC-Alpha-7_3_2019-11_38_48-AM.gif?t=1566964842\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Economy</h2>Almost everything in the CSC universe can be crafted from resources openly available in the universe.
