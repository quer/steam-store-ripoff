A plot of land awaits your green thumb to transform it into a booming farm, and a new world beckons you to explore its secrets. <br><br>Farm Folks offers a delightful mix of RPG and farming mechanics, giving you the freedom to get lost in the world while you build a farm from the ground up. There are many friends to be made, many crops and animals to tend, and a whole island to discover. What are you waiting for?<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/f3603b3bf9707d1d9de7a8627a72d95b_original_gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>As you begin to nurture your plot, uncover great mysteries, and meet the citizens of the island, you’ll experience the everlasting magnificence of your new home first-hand--all while you rekindle the memories from your past that caused you to embark on this grand, exciting adventure in the first place. You never would have guessed that finding your purpose in life was just a shipwreck away...<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/New-Life-Awaits.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/acd294ffb3500a99e9118f9f14e5e6b3_original-(1).gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>In Farm Folks, live your life as you see fit--there are so many experiences to be had! Working the land and rearing animals is a bunch of fun, but there is so much more on offer here.

Farm Folks features the time-tested farming mechanic in which players can purchase or forage seeds and begin to grow their farm into a bountiful and rewarding resource.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/4677c0371aa82ec6a5f7fd308104a5e8_original.gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/798687e73db43b99b8b925ac21b85764_original.gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>Once the soil is tilled and the seeds are nestled firmly into the ground, it’s time for some TLC--Tender Loving Care. You’ll water your plants daily, either by hand or through other means, until each crop has reached its maturation and it’s ready for harvest. Harvesting your hard-earned bounty can reward you in many ways, but if you’re focusing on that bottom line, then it’s time to put some coin in your purse.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/9ad19ab82aca8bb51eb3a796188abee0_original.gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/c146d232d6e996c6d50269b04819d135_original.gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>After loading your haul onto your trusty mount, you’ll head into town and sell your goods to the island’s exporters. As your purse grows fatter and fatter, the farming process can be enhanced and streamlined until you’re running the island’s most booming farm.<br><br>Soon you’ll be wondering if it’s time to invest in one of those fancy mainland automobiles....or maybe someone who can help out around the farm…<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/Raising_Animals.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>Softshoal Island’s farmland is so very fertile because of the island’s local animal population and the generations they’ve spent grazing every acre of the luscious landscape. Today, farmers can continue to reap the rewards of Softshoal’s four-legged (and two-legged!) friends by giving them homes on your property.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/a8c6ea4cb0e5569eec162b047fd1e000_original.gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>The local forester is also a great carpenter, and he’ll make any kind of coop or stable that’s available--for a price, of course. Once the structure is built, you’ll need to stop by the nearby animal breeder to purchase some healthy livestock! Before you know it, you’ll be in the ranching business. Milk, eggs, and wool, oh my!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/73cd12b6302f1e1247d82c7016c1594f_original.gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>Nurture and care is key to making sure your livestock is producing worthwhile products. The happier your animal companions are, the higher the quality of their yield!

You’ll need to explore the wonderful and diverse settings of Softshoal to find the valuable items that can’t be found on a shelf in the local general store. These resources include minerals and materials for upgrading your tools--usually mined from Softshoal’s extensive cave system, or fish and other precious sea life that can be fished from the island’s various rivers, lakes and coastlines.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/a6a5e7c44367ce77377ccdb92a295071_original.gif..png?t=1531862681\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/d5909ab3151364166c8808b5a5547375_original.gif.png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>Your progression is enhanced by what you find in the wilds of Softshoal, and sometimes searching for something trivial can lead to a grand adventure you never saw coming.

From those that live in the island’s coastal town, Port Meridia, to those found out in the wilds, Farm Folks features a diverse, well-thought cast of over thirty characters. <br>You’ll meet them, find ways to further your relationships with them, and soon you’ll know each one by name. These citizens offer quests a-plenty, and spout dialogue that’ll keep you coming back for more. High relationships come with high rewards, but don’t think everybody in Softshoal is going to be easy to please...<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/e6066982c1000c7bfc10557ded68ec5f_original.gif..png?t=1531862681\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/895160/extras/bf3161e09a2ab5a72a54674560f74742_original.gif..png?t=1531862681\" ><br><br>The seeds you sow in the community will quickly begin to bear fruit. However, you better be careful not to grow weeds! Build your relationships with townsfolk by giving them gifts, attending special events, performing quests, and remembering their birthdays. Earn enough favor and maybe the townsfolk will begin giving you gifts in kind. Some nuts are harder to crack than others, but with some finesse, they just might come around.

This fair-sized town has plenty of places to kick back and enjoy a day away from the farm, but it’s also home to the many festivals that you don’t want to miss! <br><br>Every season brings with it a great calendar of holidays that are perfect cause for celebration.
