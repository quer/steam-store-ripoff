Game's over when you fall off the track, your ragdoll character falls off the kart or when you run out of time(or all of these at once, if you're really bad).<br><br><strong>Split Screen</strong><br>In the split screen mode, your goal is to outrun one another on the same difficult tracks as before, dying or falling off the track means losing instantly.<br><br><strong>Online</strong><br>The Online multiplayer gives your kart the ability to jump and pits you against 11 more players in an arena with the sole goal to be the last survivor.<br><br><strong>Soundtrack</strong><br>We have a soundtrack of 8 songs ranging from relaxed synthwave to gritty metal for you to do your driving with, the songs are played in random order and can be skipped or muted in game.<br><br><br><strong>Future Updates</strong><br>The game will be supported in terms of bug fixes, minor updates etc..
