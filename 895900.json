From rockets to pinball bouncers, tennis ball cannons to proximity mines, it is up to you of how to get the job done. With over 70 items, 50 levels and a full-fledged sandbox level editor, the game becomes whatever you’re imagination can make it. <br><br>There's no hand holding in this Rube Goldberg style game, and with only a basic Tutorial, you are left to your own devices to experiment, design and engineer, different contraptions to see what impact or result hooking up different items together can have.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Your Challenges</h2><br>The Chaotic Workshop starts off with 50 unlockable levels for you to try your creative and problem solving skills at. Ranging from having to launch a rocket with a rubber duck, or using proximity mines to make way for a pig, each level forces you to think outside of the box. This level count will grow though with community feedback. This is only the beginning!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Your Choices</h2><br>With over 70 unlockable items in your toolbox, you have the freedom to create whatever you have at your fingertips. But much of the time, you'll be constrained to what you have! Fear not as there's often more than one way to solve each puzzle!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Your Creativity</h2><br>Ever wanted to put a Tennis Ball Gun in a room full of proximity mines, or how about a pig-launcher in an Anti Gravitational Field. <br>Well now you can. With those possible +70 items, your own creativity is the only limit in the Sandbox. Play the puzzles to unlock even more Items to add to your own personal contraptions!<br><br>Caution, Explosions are likely.",
