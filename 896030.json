When the 13th magic awoke, the battle between the chosen Summoners prevailed. The MC and female MC get dragged into a ragging war between the Summoners. What will be the results when the dust of war settles between 9 hostile Summoners?

Yoshino Reiji was just another student there until the day when a pretty girl, named No.13, accidentally saved Reiji, dragging him knee deep into a supernatural dilemma. The girl is the result of a hyper-scientific weapon called the Magical Strategic Destruction Weapon, or M.S.D.W. Showing itself to it's owner in the form of a figure granting two unique abilities: Summon anyone you've seen in the last 24 hours, and Return all physical matter to its state 24 hours prior.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nAfter this accident, the once peace-love , Reiji, was dragged into the war of 13 incredibly powerful summoners. The Samsara Magic on the Tsukuyomi island caused the Summoners to repeat disasters day after day. He will have to risk everything he loves and protect the one thing that he truly cares about to maintain a normal and boring school life.",
