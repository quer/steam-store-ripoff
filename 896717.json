In the early 19th Century, a combination of horse-drawn transport and sailing ships was the only option; that was until the 1840s, when the Chester and Crewe Railway and later, the Chester and Holyhead Railway were incorporated. <br><br>The full line was soon completed in 1848. Irish Mail would regularly work the line from London to Holyhead, and the LNWR, being in control of the West Coast Main Line and the line to Holyhead soon after, saw an opportunity for a spike in tourist traffic. Trains were put on to serve seaside resorts like Rhyl, Colwyn Bay and along the Llandudno branch, setting in stone the line’s popularity. This tale would continue through the Big Four, British Railways and Sectorisation eras, and despite freight being less common today, the line has remained a local and long-distance passenger haven with over 90 trains a day.<br><br>Visit the seaside today with North Wales Coastal Extension, which now allows you to enjoy the entire Crewe to Holyhead route, featuring the Virgin Trains BR Class 221 “Super Voyager”, and Arriva Trains Wales’ BR Class 158 “Express Sprinter” and BR Class 175 “Coradia” DMUs.<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>The North Wales Coastal Route Extension Add-On includes 7 challenging career scenarios and 2 Railfan Mode scenarios<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[221] 01.
