Continuing their fantastic LMS line-up, Bossman Games have delivered yet another engine you need to have in your collection!<br><br>The Royal Scot Class was designed by Sir Henry Fowler for express passenger work on the London Midland and Scottish Railway, as it was a type of locomotive sorely lacking among the fleet. A total of 70 were produced from the LMS’ Derby Works, 50 in 1927 and a further 20 in 1930. The class was noted to be successful despite undergoing no testing before entering service, working top link expresses out of London Euston before the arrival of the Princess Royal and Princess Coronation classes.<br><br>However, once the fleet’s boilers started to show their age, it was decided to rebuild them using the modern, type 2A boiler designed by Sir William Stanier. Many other changes would also take place during the rebuild, particularly to the frames and cylinders. All 70 would be rebuilt between the mid-1940s and 1950s.<br><br>The rebuilt locomotives were masterpieces, capable of matching the Coronations in service, all while being much smaller in comparison. LMS gave the rebuilt Royal Scots a power classification of 6P, one above the likes of the Black Five and Jubilee, however British Railways would later revise this to 7P, acknowledging their newfound strength.<br><br>The rebuilt Royal Scots would work under BR until 1965, and out of the 70 built, two survived into preservation, working mainline and heritage railway railtours and excursions throughout the subsequent years.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>The LMS Rebuilt Royal Scot Steam Loco Add-On includes six challenging and engaging career scenarios for the North Wales Coastal: Crewe - Llandudno and Liverpool – Manchester routes:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>01.
