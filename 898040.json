            "detailed_description": "<strong>Whirlygig </strong>is a block building game which consists of 4 unique grids – Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer.  Blocks move upward in Fall, to the right in Winter, downward in Spring, and to the left in Summer.  Every 5 turns, a new grid is randomly selected as the next grid to play in.<br><br><strong>Block Control:</strong>  Blocks can be controlled with keyboard or joystick inputs.  Blocks can be rotated clockwise or counter clockwise.  The controls can be updated by the user within the Controls screen.  <br><br><strong>Game Levels:</strong>  The beginning level of the game is set by the user when selecting the difficulty.  This dictates the speed of the block fall, the movement of the blocks from side-to-side, and the number of points achieved when destroying rows of blocks or activating a special bomb.  Every 10 rows destroyed increases the level as long as the level is greater than the starting difficulty selected by the user.<br><br><strong>Scoring:</strong>  Points are accumulated when 1 to 5 rows of blocks are destroyed, or a bomb is detonated.  The more rows that are destroyed at once or individual pieces blown up, the higher the points earned.  <br><br><strong>Game Over: </strong> The game has no timer or restriction on number of levels, lines, or blocks.  The game ends when the block level reaches any of the 4 spawn points.<br><br><strong>Whirlygig:</strong>  4 destroyed rows at once is called a Whirlygig.  When this is achieved, a bonus piece is created.  The user has 5 turns to destroy this bonus piece to receive a good block that will be stored within the grid for later use.  If the bonus piece is not cleared, the user receives a bad block immediately.  Up to 3 good blocks can be stored in each grid, but only one can be activated in a given turn.  However, good blocks can be activated one after the other, and their spawning is in addition to the 5 standard turns received in the grid.<br><br>Extra Long = The extra long good block is 5 pieces high allowing the user to obtain a higher score by destroying 5 rows at once. <br>Bomb = The bomb good block destroys any piece to the left, right, top, or bottom of the bomb.  The bomb itself is also destroyed in the process.<br>Single = The single good block spawns 3 consecutive single blocks for the user.",
