This network helps our worlds to survive, and it supports the structure of our reality itself. You know, so it doesn’t collapse and kill everyone.<br><br>Yes, if just one world becomes unanchored, they will all become crushed under the infinite weight of the original universe.

Through a twist of fate, they are offered the chance to save not only our world, but five others that traverse various themes, from brassy steampunk to sleek sci-fi. The adventure is daring and bold—exploring not only choices, but the aftermath that comes with them, in an unflinching narrative that’s not afraid to address the darkest sides of idealism.<br><br>Will you find yourself sympathizing with the antagonists? Will the correct choice always be the right one? Readers will find their wills tested and their morals challenged throughout the adventure.<br><br>Each choice may have an impact as players discover 20 endings, either advancing the plot or obtaining glimpses of a far darker outcome. An all-original soundtrack provides exceptional reach and emotional depth, while optional romance with multiple genders and sexualities makes Crown of Worlds an adventure that can be enjoyed by a wide adult audience.
