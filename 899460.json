To the south lies the Empire and perpetual war, while to the north there is only the Murk--a seething wall of fog from which no ship has ever returned. In the midst of these grand forces, both natural and otherwise, our heroes must find a way to survive and to pursue their dreams of liberty.<br><br>Play as the newly-made leader of a mercenary company, fresh off an assignment gone awry. Now on the wrong side of the Crown, allies and loyalty are paramount. Forced to venture through the maw of the Murk in a search for truth, players will explore unknown lands, forge new alliances, and wage battle against those who would see to their end.

Shores Unknown is accessible to players who avoid classic grid-based RPG gameplay, while offering broad character enhancements, stat upgrades, and squad management tools which satisfy a healthy appetite for tactical strategy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Developer</h2>Vallynne's development team brings with them a breadth of industry experience, helping to drive their vision for Shores' unique, genre-defining gameplay.

The composer, Claudi Martinez, brings his keen ear and experience in sound design from notable projects such as Kingdom of Loot.",
