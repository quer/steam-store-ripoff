Grotesque humanoid creatures pursue you at every turn. Crime syndicates and shadowy organizations plot behind closed doors.

Explore a wide variety of locations while you uncover secrets and piece together fragments of a deep, interwoven story. Navigate sections of a seemingly endless city filled with claustrophobic alleyways, labyrinthine tunnels, and dreary establishments. Segments of nerve-wracking terror are broken up by exploration, puzzle-solving, and world-building sections - providing brief respite from high-anxiety encounters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Surreal Horror</strong> - Monsters and nefarious humans are not the only things to fear.
