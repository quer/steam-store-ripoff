The second painting, <strong>Youth</strong>, shows the same rich, green landscape, but here the view widens as does the voyager's experience. Now the youth grabs the tiller firmly as the angel watches and waves from the shore, allowing him to take control. The boy's enthusiasm and energy are evident in his forward-thrusting pose and billowing clothes. In the distance, a ghostly castle hovers in the sky, a white and shimmering beacon that represents the ambitions and dreams of man. To the youth, the calm river seems to lead straight to the castle, but at the far right of the painting one can just glimpse the river as it becomes rough, choppy, and full of rocks. Cole comments on the landscape and the youth's ambitions: &quot;The scenery of the picture - its clear stream, its lofty trees, its towering mountains, its unbounded distance, and transparent atmosphere - figure forth the romantic beauty of youthful imaginings, when the mind elevates the Mean and Common into the Magnificent, before experience teaches what is the Real.&quot;<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Content Details</h2>Contains <i>one</i> new puzzle box for Masters of Puzzle. The UHD image captures the original painting in great detail which in turn allows for very detailed and diverse puzzle tiles. There are a few distinct sections in the image that can be identified relatively easily, but there are also several very similar ones in the greenery and the sky. This will make the puzzle slightly more challenging to assemble, especially for the more inexperienced puzzle builders.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/900101/extras/public_domain_icon_sm.png?t=1537870737\" > * <i>Note: The painting used in this DLC is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus 100 years or less.</i>",
