Rooks can build only once per move, and as the squares magically fall from the night sky, they might randomly &quot;pop-up&quot; goodies from out of Kingland.

You can also drop a cheese on the start square of your next move, by clicking the cheese icon before moving a piece, to allow another piece to retrieve it.<br><br>Your King can move to the same square as one of your Rooks to enter it, by pointing at the Rook's board square (instead of the base of the Rook).
