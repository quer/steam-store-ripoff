            "detailed_description": "<h1>Early Access Now Available - Please Read</h1><p><strong>Adventure Portal</strong> is now available to the public and there are some points about the game to know before choosing to support the project. The application is fully playable, current features are working, and it is still under development. There will be occasional bugs, hang ups, or other weird behaviors that show up from time to time. For the most part we enjoy and play AP weekly with few problems. It's important that new players know and understand this before choosing to support the project :steamhappy:. I want to make an easy to use, easy to learn, affordable utility for role players, and your support helps accelerate the process. If you choose to support the project and give AP a try then I thank you and hope you enjoy it! I posted a video walk through of all current features and how they operate above.<br><br>A couple of additional things to note about Adventure Portal before supporting (points about the current state and are subject to change in future updates):<br><br>- currently online only<br>- based on 5e gameplay rules only<br>- future updates to dm and player profiles might make current profile saves obsolete (will warn ahead of time)<br>- contains bugs! (please check the forums for reporting)<br>- does not feature in game voice chat (yet)<br><br>If that didn't scare you away and you choose to support the project -- thank you for the support!<br><br>- Brian</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Welcome</strong></h2><br>Adventure Portal is a simple platform that allows players to connect and run their pen and paper role playing campaigns online!  It is currently constructed to support 5th edition play.  This is a ongoing project that will see additions and improvements as support grows.  I built this to be a simple and easy to use alternative to the more complicated and expensive options out there.<br><br>Adventure Portal features player and gm profiles that hold stats and campaign information, an encounter/world map where players and DMs can place custom tokens -- each with their own information sheets, sizes, names, images, and a sound and music board for storytelling enrichment.",
