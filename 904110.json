Take a look at three new classes that foretell impending doom and either work to prevent or actively embrace it, which have been created for the world’s most popular roleplaying game!<br><br><strong>The Deathseer.</strong> This class is a one-third caster, focused maintaining the balance between life and death by signing a &quot;Reaper's Contract&quot; - an agreement they strike with a deity to act on their behalf. They may choose to bind themselves into servitude for any number of reasons, be it to protect the weak from perishing before their time, possess the ability to make difficult decisions without being clouded by moral ambiguity, or because they simply revel in battle and conflict. Regardless of the reason, their deity's expectations are unwavering, and for their obedience deathseers are granted a seemingly limitless source of power to carry out their will. The Deathseer is a complete 5e class with three fully detailed archetypes, called reapers, which will give players unique options when creating and playing their characters. The archetypes are: Reaper of Mettle, Reaper of Omen, and Reaper of Ruin.<br><br><strong>The Pale Master.</strong> A fan favorite everyone loved in 3.5e, right? Well, here is a complete re-imagining of that flavor and adapting it to 5E. The Pale Master is in intelligence-based caster obsessed with the necromantic arts. They specialize in spells and incantations that allow them to harness the very life-force that flows through all creatures. Where a life-force is not present, they are able to instill a mimicry of foul life, rising these dead creatures from their once peaceful earthen resting places. All of the old hallmarks are present: undead graft, summoning an undead servant and necromancy specialization. To obtain these gifts, the Pale Master forgoes study in the other arcane disciplines (drastically reducing their spell list in favor of undead gifts). The Pale Master is a complete 5e class with three fully detailed archetypes, called requiems, which will give players unique options when creating and playing their characters. The archetypes are: Requiem of Ash, Requiem of Haunt, and Requiem of Torpor.<br><br><strong>The Vicar.</strong> This class is a pious pact magic caster. Typically, high-ranking members of their clergy, vicars seek a greater purpose. In this search, they are guided by their deity to pledge themselves into the service of a celestial being and are granted divine powers as a reward for this devotion. However, patrons don't accept a pledge from everyone who seeks to enter into their service, rather only those deemed capable of carrying out their duties are brought under their tutelage. The Vicar is a complete 5e class with three fully detailed archetypes, called pledges of foundation, which will give players unique options when creating and playing their characters. The archetypes are: Pledge of the Curator, Pledge of the Predicant, and Pledge of the Watcher.<br><br><i>Included in this 5e compatible Class Pack:</i><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Three fully fleshed out classes with lore, art, custom abilities, and three detailed archetypes<br></li><li>Full spell lists for each class, referencing some custom spell names found in Grimlore's Grimoire<br></li><li>Leveling automation allows you to easily level your characters as you would with other modules</li></ul><br><i>Converted by:</i> Trevor Armstrong<br><br>Released on July 18, 2018.
