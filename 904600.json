The goal is to gain as many points as you can by interacting with other contestants and to be the winner at the end. You must gain enough points in order to avoid being on the last two place on the points table. Your interactions are limited, so think carefully and plan your strategy based on the skills you've chosen. The winner of the day gets the right to send one of the last two contestants. If you are willing to shape the community, your aim must be to win each day. As a reward for being the winner, you get a satisfaction of sending someone you don't like.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/904600/extras/features.png?t=1543371495\" ><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/904600/extras/choices.png?t=1543371495\" ><br><br>Every single interaction has a consequence and the time is limited.
