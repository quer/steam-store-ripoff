A player finds themselves in a strange world called &quot;Weaverse&quot; - they don't know where they are or how they got there. And it appears they don't remember anything up to this point. Almost immediately the player is contacted by a group of characters with similar symptoms and together they start an investigation to unravel these mysteries. What is Weaverse? Why can't they remember anything? These and many other questions will be answered in the most unexpected ways.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/906750/extras/gameplay-title.png?t=1544874815\" ><br>At its core, Weaverse is a first-person shooter, with strong exploration and puzzle elements. The Town Square is a safe space where the player can go to seek shelter, trade with merchants or talk to quest givers. Teleport Room that can be found there is used to reach other worlds (dungeons), but only after they were found by the player via story quests or by exploring the Town Square's dark corners (in which you can find secret passages to any of the worlds). There are four worlds in Weaverse - Plastic, Snow, Metal, and Darkness, with the Town Square being the fifth hub world. Each world has its own gameplay twist.<br><br>The Plastic world is full of hidden passages and fake walls. In the Snow world, the player will face many liquid-based puzzles (simple example - turn a small lake to ice in order to cross it). Tricky mechanical devices waiting for the player in the Metal world. Finally, the Darkness is a maze, where you need to find Living Keys and escort them to corresponding locks in order to succeed.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/906750/extras/roomsystem-title.png?t=1544874815\" ><br>There is no &quot;Game Over&quot; screen in Weaverse. Instead of dying, the player teleports to the Well when HP is depleted. Upon climbing the Well to the top, player transports to the Secret Room, nearest to the player’s &quot;death&quot; location.
