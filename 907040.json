Its also more fun for just a quick race, no need to spend time setting up any controllers!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simple Rating</h2>Simple Rating is an individual player rank that goes from 0 to 99. Everyone starts on 45, but depending on whether you finish or not your races and drive cleanly this can rise and fall. Simple Rating is visible to all players in a lobby.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Developer and Future Updates</h2>As Simple Racing is a hobby project and therefore an indie game, updates will be small and irregular.
