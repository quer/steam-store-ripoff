Israelis living in Tehran enjoyed great privilege and wealth. Such was the much coveted “friendship of the Middle East”—Iran supplied oil while Israel helped with infrastructure and weapons. It seemed idyllic; but a storm was brewing, the warnings of which were largely ignored. In 1979 that storm erupted. The Islamic Revolution shook the Shah's regime. Suddenly, the Israelis in Tehran were the enemies of the people and existed in fear for their very lives. Director Dan Shadur's family was there at the time. Interviewing many who were forced to flee, as well as using a wealth of news and personal footage shot during these events, he has crafted a riveting and intimate look at the seismic political shift that has formed the Middle East we know today. BEFORE THE REVOLUTION highlights the unknown and real story of the cultural tidal wave that hit Iran and the men, women, and children who were caught in its path.",
