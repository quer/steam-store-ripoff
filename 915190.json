It's currently a bit unpolished, but I'll try to improve and add to it in future updates.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHAT HAS CHANGED?</h2>A lot has changed from the first game! First of all, the whole game has been remade in Unity. The graphics are similar, but much more clean, simple and high resolution. There is also a level editor! This means you can make levels, but it also means I can make more levels much faster! So, yeah, there's a ton of new levels! There are also a bunch of different drivers to choose from, new boss fights, weird characters, more story, and some music and sound effects! WHEW THAT WAS A LOT OF STUFF HUH!?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SO, WHO MADE THIS THING?</h2>I'm a 14 year old developer and I make games in my free time. This is my first try at a &quot;commercial&quot; (ish) game. It's taken about 8 months to develop, so hope you enjoy it :D",
