When the hordes reached the diner, the young waitress was the only survivor, thanks to the Colt 1911 - a present from her father on her 9:th birthday - that she never left out of reach even before the end of the world. What really ticked her off was when one of the undead managed to mess up her hair on the same day as she had been to the salon. The killing spree that followed is said to have made even the undead sick to their stomach and chances are that some of the corpses she left behind in the diner wasn't really dead to begin with. But don't even hint about that to Jane if you know what's good for you. <br><br>Anyway, since the trailer park that had been Jane's home since birth was completely overrun by the hordes, Jane has made it her mission in life to kill again what is already dead.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/916540/extras/Jane.png?t=1549661975\" > <i>Trailer Jane</i><br><br><strong>Deputy Klaus</strong><br>When the hordes descended on Dirtmine, Arizona, Deputy Klaus was busy, escorting an undesired bum out of town and &quot;mildly persuading&quot; him never to return. As Klaus came back to the sheriff's office, no one appeared to be left alive. A few minutes later, Klaus had made sure that no one was left moving as well. Some people say that there actually was a survivor, a local man that spent every other night in lockup due to a habit involving drinking, fighting and... well mainly drinking and fighting. Since Klaus was a firm believer in the value of teaching lessons, it is not unlikely that if so, Klaus may have just left him in his cell awaiting the sheriff's order to release the prisoner, as regulations stated. At least if there was nothing in the regulations about making exceptions in case the sheriff was no longer able to issue such an order due to being busy prowling the streets with an urge to devour human flesh.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/916540/extras/Klaus.png?t=1549661975\" > <i>Deputy Klaus</i><br><br><strong>Samu Jin</strong><br>A tech student who really didn't bother to hang out with anyone else, Jin spent most of his time prior to <i>The Outbreak</i> studying or practicing with the ancient sword replica he purchased on eBuy.

As <i>The Outbreak</i> came, Jin was convinced that it was caused by something in the air, perhaps something to do with chemtrails. Although there's been no proof of such a connection since, Jin retains his conviction about the state of the matter and prefers to keep his gas mask on at all times.

He never spoke much and he easily got confused when people talked fast or used difficult words. You might expect a kid like that to get bullied badly by the other kids, and it might have happened to Mike as well, had it not been for one reason: He was simply huge.

He had an amazing understanding of engines and mechanics, far beyond what anyone could expect of a professional mechanic or engineer. As his mother was one of the first victims on The Outbreak, Mike ran from town.
