The game background is the end of the Ming Dynasty, when the smoke is everywhere, in the East, all kinds of rangers, chaos, gangsters and Western mercenaries, pirates, etc. in this troubled world for the survival and interests. &quot;The Blade&quot; uses the form of the binding of weapons and action skills to reproduce the various desperate people in the world of the late Ming Dynasty. Players can play Chinese knights, or Japanese rogues, or Western knights, in order to survive and materialize all kinds of fights. The game's action fighting elements are very hardcore and cover all the elements of all hardcore ACT games. Attacks are divided into melee and remote, and there are operational elements such as tumbling, block, bounce, and grabbing and geography.
