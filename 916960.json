Our development team loves playing, making and discovering new video games, especially indie games. <br>So, our goal here is to make a real and successful early access. That means 3 things: <br> 1. Provide a real game from the start: while we will add new content in the next months, the early access version is a real video game, already fun and well-polished<br> 2. Include the game community: we would like to include as much as possible the gamer community in this phase of the development process. So, join our discord <br>     server to brainstorm with us on new minigames idea, the design of new objects for the sandbox mode or just to say hello! <br> 3.
