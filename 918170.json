Try out different hacks, get creative, entertain yourself! And hey, maybe you'll find a secret or two along the way!<br><br>This is an infinite platformer with horizontal player movement. When the game is started, two tabs open: one with the platformer itself, and one that appears to be a command prompt. A narrator starts speaking, and quickly notes that the platformer seems to be dull and uninteresting. He then tutorials the player on how to &quot;hack&quot;. &quot;Hacking&quot; gives the ability to change important variables in the code and to enable things that affect the environment.<br><br>As the narrator will explain, to &quot;hack&quot;, the player must press the &quot;h&quot; key while the platformer tab is selected. The platformer will then freeze as it waits for input from the hacking tab (the one that looks like a command prompt). The player then must switch to the command prompt, type in a &quot;hack&quot;, and press enter. They will then be prompted to enter an integer (numbers), string (words), or boolean (true/false) to complete the hack. After completing the hack, the player can go back to the platformer to see what changed.<br><br>Here's an example of what happens in the hacking tab with a player doubling their speed:<br>-------------------<br>Enter Hack: <strong>speed</strong><br>-------------------<br>Speed Hack:<br>-------------------<br>Variable Type: Integer<br>Default State: 6<br>Current State: 6<br>-------------------<br>Enter new speed: <strong>12</strong><br>Hack Successful!<br>-------------------<br>Hacking process complete<br>Go back to the game<br>-------------------<br><br>The game encourages using trial and error to see what each hack does (and using the hack &quot;list&quot; to see which hacks exist), but here's what they do if you don't want to test them out for yourself:<br><br>&quot;ascend&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, platforms rise into the sky whenever the player steps on them.<br>&quot;birdNumber&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the maximum amount of birds the player can spawn.<br>&quot;birdPoop&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, birds will occasionally drop bird poop.<br>&quot;birdPoopRate&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the rate at which birds can drop poop (&quot;birdPoop&quot; must be enabled to see this change).<br>&quot;birdSpeed&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the speed at which the birds fly.<br>&quot;blackhole&quot; - Enter a boolean. Enables a blackhole that sucks in all sprites and the player's mouse. The game warns you to have caution, since it will take control of your mouse while this hack is enabled.<br>&quot;clearScreen&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the command prompt is cleared.<br>&quot;clone&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, clones of the player can be created by pressing the space bar.<br>&quot;color&quot; - Enter three integers, as instructed. Affects the background color of the sky.<br>&quot;deathTouch&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player destroys whatever they touch.<br>&quot;fly&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player can fly.<br>&quot;gravity&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the strength of the game's gravity.<br>&quot;jump&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the player's jump height.<br>&quot;language&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the language of the words &quot;Dull Platformer&quot; at the top of the tab, and of the &quot;Ouch&quot; said by sprites when they crash their heads into platforms.<br>&quot;list&quot; - Shows this list of hacks. Does not show the hack &quot;secret&quot;.<br>&quot;morph&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the player into other sprites in the game. Your hit-box and abilities are updated accordingly.<br>&quot;mousePlay&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player becomes your mouse, and the game attempts to give your mouse collision detection. As with the hack &quot;blackhole&quot;, the game cautions you that this hack will take control of your mouse.<br>&quot;multiplayer&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, a second player can join by playing on the same keyboard as instructed.<br>&quot;music&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Allows players to change the sounds of the game to a song, silence, or the tutorial again.<br>&quot;secret&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the birds and flowers get sunglasses.<br>&quot;speed&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the speed of the player.<br>&quot;weather&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the weather of the platformer.<br><br>As players experiment with different hacks, 5 pieces of a key can be found. When the player finds all 5 pieces, the narrator comes back to speak to you and the ending is unlocked.",
