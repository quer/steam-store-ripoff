We sort of mashed those two together in Felix The Reaper. <br><br>For the character himself and the world around him the inspiration was more diverse: in that aspect, the game contains inspiration from the ancient tv-show <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, medieval painters like <i>Bruegel</i> and <i>Bosch</i> and the cartoon characters of <i>Adventure Time</i> and <i>Hayao Miyazaki</i>.<br><br>Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper were the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We've worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and historian scholars.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Dance</h2>Several dancers have been around throughout the production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves, that ended up in the game.<br><br>Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix:<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/919410/extras/STEAMassets_SPLITSCREEN_Gunilla.gif.png?t=1538038327\" ><br><br>And here's Raphael doing another:<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/919410/extras/STEAMassets_SPLITSCREEN_Raphael.gif.png?t=1538038327\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Music</h2>Of course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music - why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. That makes for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Art History</h2>The idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with <i>The Danse Macabre</i> and <i>Death and The Maiden</i> as a basis and then asked ourselves: how can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. <br><br>Parallel to the production a historical scholar has dived into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it in the game, if it fit.
