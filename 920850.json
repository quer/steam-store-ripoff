At the end of each level, there will be a vast upgrade window for you, which is much help in the fight against the invaders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUpgrade the skills, monitor the resources and drive the Orcs back into their world. The key to victory is a carefully considered and designed strategy! Only then you can save the blooming lands of Landriel!",
