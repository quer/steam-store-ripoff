This new DLC will take you back to the 80's in a time when coin-operated (coin-op) arcades were in their golden age (late 1970's to mid 1980's). This arcade is inspired by one of the teams favorite 80's movies, in relation to VR! It will give you a bright colorful space to work in. The depth in this scene exceeds our previously released rooms so we hope this room takes your VR experience to the next level. <br><br>All props have an alternate material (available on your vr controller's radial dial menu) for changing the arcade's specialised baked-in lighting for the arcade. This way you can use the props in your other rooms too!<br><br><i>*The props in the arcade rooms are positionally locked. You can unlock all props and move them around at your will. Rearrange your arcades and fill in the missing ones in the back all you want. </i><br><br><i>*The included Arcade machines and Pinball machine are themed after MyDream Interactive's growing game list. Including our original voxel-game self-titled &quot;MyDream&quot;, our first VR game &quot;Siege Hammer,&quot; a kids VR game &quot;Candy Squad,&quot; and the latest game &quot;The Adoraboos&quot; for iOS and Android. </i><br><br><strong> Arcade.room</strong> <br>This room starts you just inside the enterance of the arcade. Your main monitor screen is in front of you and We've loaded up a web browser for you with the latest top times for video game speed-runs to your right side. In the back, above the arcade you'll see a small apartment behind the window shades. <br><br><strong> Arcade-apartment.room</strong> <br>This room starts you in the apartment-like loft resting above the arcade.
