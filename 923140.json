The imperial guard of the nearby capital city may prove difficult to avoid. It details the rise of a Wyvern Wraith and the plight of a Witch Wraith.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Game is an RPG Game and its game play is like WOW in that the game has levels of gear and it also has great graphical terrains of desert scenes and beach scenes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is still in development. The Objectives still need to be implemented.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis has an advanced inventory and it saves progress this is the completed inventory. The 2nd partial inventory will be adapted over time as the code needs to be coded for each individual object and this takes time. Some are coded in this edition and some are not yet implemented. Inventory &amp; Quests keys: J,K,I. Horse Mount Keys: F.<br />\r\nCamera: F1,F2,F3. Keys may differ from Mac to Windows Versions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe RPG Game(Elven Magic 2) is coded with Effects working on most builds and allows for attack, these effects will be relied on without the use of weapons at this stage as melee combat will be introduced later without the use of guns specifically as a weapon. As the games storyline will not involve guns for attack of any humanoids, only creatures will be attacked using guns which will not be implemented as a weapon at all, only in the inventory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nElven Magic FPS is available for prepurchase and at this stage, you can attack and the Inventory works as well as character sheet and crafting functioning is coming soon as recipes need to be added. You can also ride a horse on the beach in one scene. Things like purchasing of equipment will be added in time, if there is any please don't purchase anything in-game due to weather saving functionality works you can buy the game still as it is in beta not everything is working.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Main Game (ElvenMagicPro) is not Required to load and play Elven Magic 2 and Elven Magic SE which are working well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease Purchase as a bundle as this is the cheapest way at this stage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPrices may change without prior notice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game can be implemented with over 30GB of content at this stage each build takes only 2.5GB.",

Some with a little magic and others with a lot but they come in various shapes and sizes so to speak. Enjoyed reading the books although short, they were pretty interesting and in places riveting. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an enjoyable read but especially to all you Elf buffs out there.”<br>5 of 5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.amazon.com/Elven-Magic-Book-Daniel-Chay-ebook/dp/B00LQ0SDBQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1534136011&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=daniel+chay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Amazon</a><br>",
