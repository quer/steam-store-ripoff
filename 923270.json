Now you can! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Forum was the center of the ancient city. Here were located the major law courts, government buildings, temples of the state religion, and historic monuments.

This VR app puts you in the driver's seat, making it possible to teleport on your own from site to site around Rome Reborn®'s reconstruction of the Forum, which took over twenty years of collaboration between archaeologists and graphics technicians to re-create. As you explore the Forum, you can  read brief descriptions on the virtual tablet that always accompanies you and, if you wish, you may also listen to experts' explanations of the people, monuments, and buildings you are encountering along the way.  You can use the app's Time Warp feature to toggle between the ruins today and their original appearance.  Take a full visit for about 3 hours, or see just the sites of interest to you.  You can select any of the following languages: Chinese, English, Italian.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you have finished using the app, you are encouraged to go to the Community section of Rome Reborn®'s website, register, take assessments to gauge your level of expertise, and earn rewards for your achievements.

I have followed the development of Rome Reborn VR since its inception in the 1990s. Now that the first VR applications of the project are starting to appear in online stores, I am delighted to express my strong support for this unique initiative which combines archaeological accuracy with state-of-the-art technology. The goal is to make the core monuments of the Eternal City easily comprehensible even to non-experts, and to bring ancient Rome into the homes and schools of people wherever they may be. In my opinion, the Rome Reborn VR team has brilliantly achieved this goal. --Prof. Paolo Liverani”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo, University of Florence (Italy)</a><br><br>“As Director of the Civic Museum of Rieti, about 80 km north of Rome, on Saturday, May 26, 2018 I organized, at the museum, two public demonstrations of the Rome Reborn VR application presenting the Roman Forum. Over 100 people of all ages attended both demonstrations. I can report that the response was enthusiastically positive. The event showed that Rome Reborn VR has the potential to make the study of history come alive for students and the general public. Rome Reborn VR is a great tool for the museum world and for anyone around the world who wants to learn more about ancient Rome by going back in time to visit the city as it appeared at the peak of its development in AD 320. --Dr. Monica De Simone”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Civic Museum of Rieti (Italy)</a><br><br>“This is an *amazing* pedagogical tool with lots of applications in secondary and higher education. As a professor of Classics, I consider Roman Reborn VR an indispensable tool for courses on Roman civilization, Roman history, Roman archaeology, even Latin literature. While this app has a lot to offer to faculty and students, it will also appeal to non-academics who are interested in ancient Rome. --Prof. Zoe Stamatopoulou”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Department of Classics, Washington University (USA)</a><br>",
