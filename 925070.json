Discover and use powerful artifacts, track your achievements, and experience multiple game modes, including the appropriately named &quot;Scary nightmare mode.&quot; (You won't want to play this mode alone at night!)<br><br>Do you have a rational mind and a strong heart? If so, you just might survive to the end. If not, don't say we didn't warn you.
