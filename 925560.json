Ninja robots Robyu and Bytron race to recover the golden skulls that have been stolen by each of Giorqio's 8 Hench-bots. Slicing everything in their path, they must reach their destination quickly. The Hench-bots grow stronger with time and exposure to the skulls. <br><br>But Robyu and Bytron have counter measures. In each level, collect gears enabling double jump, dash attack, and shuriken attack. Maintain all 3 at once and subsequent gears engage super speed! But it's not that simple - take damage, and you lose whatever you have. Will you play slow and risk a tough boss fight? Will you play fast and risk taking damage? The faster you finish, the more skull power you can convert into UPGRADES! Acquire permanent augments like triple jump, infinite dash, spread shot, extra health/lives, and much more!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/925560/extras/steamTextVisuals.png?t=1534947637\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Vibrant, hand-drawn, comic art style<br></li><li>Large, colorful character sprites<br></li><li>Travel to exotic locales all over the bot-globe<br></li><li>Detailed cinematic cutscenes with a retro feel<br></li><li>Screen-filling boss fights</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/925560/extras/steamTextAction.png?t=1534947637\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Challenging difficulty level<br></li><li>Single-hit kills; no grinding<br></li><li>Full-view camera; keep focused on the action in front of you<br></li><li>Gears and upgrades to increase speed<br></li><li>Many different types of enemies coming for you at all times<br></li><li>Hard driving metal-meets-8-bit soundtrack performed by renowned artist Daniel Tidwell</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/925560/extras/steamTextReplay.png?t=1534947637\" ><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Executing faster leads to rewards<br></li><li>Rewards allow you to go even faster<br></li><li>Non-linear level progression<br></li><li>Beat your best times in 8 sprawling Hench-bot levels, plus a multi-level endgame<br></li><li>Play with a friend in local co-op</li></ul><br>Watch for Early Access in late 2018 will full release in 2019!<br><br>Follow our progress on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BotGaiden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >https://twitter.com/BotGaiden</a>",
