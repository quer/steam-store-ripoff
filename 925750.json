Purchasing the Shattered Bloodline DLC will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor, and an exclusive item for the new survivor.<br><br>What lies beneath the mundane can be terrifying. Under the layers of quaint family life, violence festers. When this dark rampant force lashes out, lives are broken and families shattered. Wrath was her bloodline. She came home to find unimaginable horrors, which left their mark. Now she walks, haunting and vengeful, between this world and the next.  Adam Francis has no legacy, no inheritance. Everything he owns, he had to earn. Disciplined and driven, he knows he can do anything when he puts his mind to it.  His hard work paid off when he found a job miles away from home.

The wrath that flows through her veins is her legacy. The terrible pain she suffered set it off. Swift and lethal, The Spirit exacts her revenge endlessly. The Spirit is a phase-walking Killer able to catch Survivors off-guard with her traversal power, Yamaoka’s Haunting. <br><br><strong>Killer Power - The Spirit: Yamaoka’s Haunting</strong><br><br><br>Yamoka is the name she carries from her ancestors, who unleashed hell on the battlefield. The Spirit draws her power from their wrath, haunting the living as retribution for her suffering. The Spirit can use her power, Yamaoka’s Haunting, to enter an ethereal plane and phase-walk to a new location, unseen by human eyes. <br>While Yamaoka’s Haunting is active:<br><br>-The Spirit may traverse freely to a new location, moving at a faster rate for a short duration. She is still confined to movement within the physical environments and surroundings.<br><br>-The Spirit leaves the physical plane, losing sight of all Survivors. She can, however, still sense the scratch marks they leave in the environment.<br><br>-The Spirit will produce an audible cue at her current location. Once the power has ended, The Spirit retains her speed boost for a brief period and her husk fades away.<br>Using Yamaoka’s Haunting depletes The Spirit's power bar. The power bar will automatically replenish over time.
