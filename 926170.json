Draw a straight line between two dots of the same color to paint the dots between them. However, you can only change dots of one color at a time.

For example the square dot lets you change the direction of your line, or the triangle dots are synchronized such that changing one of them changes all of them.<br><br><strong>Achromatic</strong> features an original and relaxing sound track to accompany its polished minimalist aesthetic.
