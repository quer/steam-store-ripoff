Your aim is to defeat the Lich King Raeleus and the false god NOG at the deepest depths of the dungeon.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nYou explore randomly generated dungeons across eight floors, each composed of 4 x 4 room. In each room you might find treasure, a shop, enemies or something else!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nYour adventurer can hire companions (up to your current hire point limit) and enter battle when you encounter enemies. Hire points can be upgraded after levelling up.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nFighting is turn-based. Each character has two action points and each character's skill has either a cooldown time or mana requirement. For example, walking has a one-turn cooldown, so most characters can only move once per turn. A unique feature of SFD is that you can use the environment and traps to help you win the battle. Every unit has a push skill - use this to your advantage by pushing enemies into spike traps, poison gas and explosives!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nMana and inventory are common to all of your characters. Mana is recharged after each turn and can be upgraded.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nWhile the gameplay is simple, achieving victory is not! You may need to sacrifice your and your companion's lives to defeat the evil NOG!",
