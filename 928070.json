On your journey you are accompanied by your dog &quot;Speck&quot;, a German shorthaired pointer. The cabin itself seems to be left in the same condition as your father left it and you find a wide assortment of old strange books. They tell of an ancient legend of a mythological creature which the native people believed to have protected the land.
