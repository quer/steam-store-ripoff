            "detailed_description": "Prototype TD is a tower defense game which includes rogue-like elements to make each game different. The challenge of the game is in adapting to the situation you are given and figuring out what combinations of towers and map layouts will be most effective in each individual game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn many tower defense games you figure out several towers which work well and use them to win the same way each time. You also learn what spots on the map are useful and then don't have much reason to innovate further. In Prototype TD you build your map by placing blockers which the enemies have to go around, and the starting map is randomly generated so every game requires you to think carefully about how you place your walls and towers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game includes a set of towers and other bonuses which can be useful to the player, but they are not all available every game. After every 5th round, the player is given a choice of bonuses which are randomly selected, so the player must decide what is most useful to the current game and figure out what combinations of towers are strong. Across several games it becomes necessary to learn and use each tower type when the right situation arises, or to pass up on a strong tower which doesn't fit the current map.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe towers themselves explore various different ways of dealing damage or interfering with enemies. The upgrade system allows for the possibility of winning with one tower that is heavily boosted or winning with a lot of towers with less upgrades on each one. Which route you choose depends on what towers and boosts you gain access to in a particular game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game includes the best of my ideas for the tower defense game I want to play, and I enjoy playing it. If you play it and have ideas about interesting new tower types or game modes that you think would be fun, please tell me about them and I will be open to building on the game further with updates.",
