You should. Because Route 66 was born in Missouri and Missouri is home to some of its most overlooked sights and stories. In Show Me 66: Main Street Through Missouri, Missouri takes center stage in the story of the nation’s most famous highways. Although Route 66 existed for less than 60 years, it quickly claimed its place as the Main Street of America and gained mystique as a road for unexpected encounters and personal journeys. It was a road for &quot;getting your kicks&quot; and finding your spirit, an international icon with a complex legacy. Route 66 stretched 2,400 miles across eight states, but some of its most overlooked and essential stories can be found in its 300 miles through Missouri. Equal parts travelogue and historical narrative, Show Me 66 explores the sights and landscapes found along Route 66 in Missouri. It also examines the Show-Me State's biggest Route 66 stories from across the decades, including the road's birth in Springfield, the effects of World War II, the road's relationship to the Ozarks and St. Louis, its decline to the interstates, and the rediscovery still taking place today. If you're interested in Missouri history, the Ozarks, American car culture, historic preservation, or the Main Street of America, make sure this documentary film is on your must-see list!",
