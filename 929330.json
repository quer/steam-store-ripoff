The playing field is divided into 5 horizontal lanes, and with rare exceptions, a monster will only move towards the player's house along one lane. Planting costs gold, which can be gathered by farmers. Most units can only attack or defend against monsters in the lane they are put in. In later levels, players can purchase stronger units with different offensive and defensive abilities.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/929330/extras/gif_1.png?t=1540337037\" ><br><br>The monsters also come in a number of types that have different attributes, in particular, speed, damage tolerance, and abilities. Monsters include those wearing armor, those who can jump or fly over units, big bosses. At various points, the player will be inundated with a huge wave of monsters.<br><br> If a monster reaches the end of a lane, a knight group will shoot forward and destroy all the monsters in that lane. However, if a monster reaches the end of that same lane for the second time, it will reach Camelot.
