The first is a proper 1920s mansion, like those you have come across in previous investigations. The second, however, is the future of this home— now an abandoned, boarded-up building. Each map presents its own series of challenges, with the investigators in the present directly affecting the investigation of their companions in the future: an item tucked beneath a loose floorboard may be found later in the same hiding place, or a rescued captive may be able to return to the mansion in the future.",
