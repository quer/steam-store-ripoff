Play as Pawda and escape the terrible cybernetic ex-soldiers animals of the zoo by flying with your jetpack and shooting. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter the end of the Sixth War, the rest of the cyborg animals used as weapons on the battlefield are confined in superzoos. In this cynical and devastated world, you incarnate Pawda, the last panda still alive. The government wants to catch and emprison you in order to clone you, but Pawda has dreams, and will do everything to escape.<br />\r\nWhen the federal agents come to chase you, you succeed to steal a jetpack from one of them, and get out of your enclosure. But the government hired veteran animals to stop you from running away, and you will have to fight the strongest ex-soldiers of the zoo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis 2D boss rush will make you face original enemies and high-level challenges that will put your nerves to a brand new test. The pixel art graphics and retrowave vibe will immerse all kinds of players in an exciting and fun mood while the music and sound will bring you back to an 80's arcade atmosphere. You will be able to fly everywhere, dodging the never-stopping assaults from your opponents. Your powerful paws will allow you to hit them even harder, but stay on guard : they will eventually get you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to our dark yet fun world.",
