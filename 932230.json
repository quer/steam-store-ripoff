Will, the protagonist, has found himself trapped inside a foreboding Mansion with no exit.

Use the Shining Trapezohedron (a mysterious crystal that is bound to Will) to shed light on your surroundings and reveal hidden messages, visions of the past and other secrets. Be careful while you explore! There will be monsters hunting you down! You must avoid being caught or face certain death.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Unsettling Atmosphere<br></li><li>Unique Gameplay<br></li><li>Multiple Solutions<br></li><li>Engaging Mystery<br></li><li>Hand Drawn Artwork<br></li><li>Inventory Management<br></li><li>The Shining Trapezohedron</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DEVELOPMENT</h2>IMMURE is currently being developed by Wither Studios as a passion project, in our free time.
