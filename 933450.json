The controller can vibrate,we support playstaion-controller and xbox-controller right now.<br><br>2. The collection-elements in the game will affect the Ending of the game and unlock the skin.But  If you don’t find them in the first round of the game,don’t be worry,we suggest you collect them at second round of the game,that is a little hard for new player~~: )<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Reviews</h2><strong>·</strong>  “there is one other feature that separates this game from the other members of the pack…See, the entire game world of Wenjia consists of parallel light and dark realms. You can switch between the two worlds with the touch of the button.It’s a tactic that I’ve seen used a few times in games recently, but it’s one that works really well here and is employed perfectly.<br>It’s tricky, but hugely rewarding when it works.<br>Should you be wishing for more from Wenjia, then there are a whole bunch of secrets to look out for and a ton of achievements to collect – both of these will give you an almighty challenge after the game is complete.”                ——TheXboxHub<br><br><strong>·</strong>  “When it comes to tricky platformers, Wenjia's world-shifting mechanic makes it unique”                   <br>——Video Chums<br><br><strong>·</strong>  “I like the uniqueness that the swapping mechanic introduces because it keeps things fresh and it also makes you think about your next move.<br>There’s a lot of diversity when it comes to the game’s levels and the variety in the levels means traversing and completing them is a very enjoyable affair.”                              ——Xbox_Alive<br><br><strong>·</strong>   “From the overall gameplay, artwork, to the creativity of the levels behind Wenjia, these are all without a doubt its strongest attributes and sets it apart from what will be a 'no-doubt' comparison to Ori and the Blind Forest.<br>Overall, I enjoyed my experience with Wenjia. Although I didn't fall in love with the story, the core gameplay mechanics and artwork kept me intrigued and satisfied during my review experience.”                              ——Xbox Addict<br><br><strong>·</strong>   “Wenjia, a game that channels that Ori-vibe quite well, is one that I’ve enjoyed sinking some time into.<br>I don’t want to spoil too much, but using a blend of mechanics such as this, Wenjia stands out as unique in the midst of recently released platformers. It helps that the game does a good job at building on these mechanics from start to end.”                              ——XboxTavern<br><br><strong>·</strong> “In the beautiful world of Wenjia, we could see abundant landscapes with nice details. <br>Of course, a pleasant and attractive aesthetic that motivates us to walk and jump from one side to another with a difficulty level increasing. And the difficult will be compensated by the tranquility that the beautiful scenarios give us. While it is not a long game or a fairly broad story, we will still have a very good time of entertainment trying to exceed each level.”                              ——Comunidadxbox<br><br><strong>·</strong> “A very artistic action game with awesome music and the switching of the world is a very unique action element. It is easy to get started because the level of difficulty is progressive.”<br>——罪恶装备Xrd-SIGN<br><br><strong>·</strong> “It is a hardcore game by difficulty, but the checkpoints are set properly. Highly recommended for all players who like platform games.”                  ——NGA鉴赏家</p><br><h1>Update log</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Version update log</h2>October 16, 2018<br><br>-increase：Achievement system   <br>-increase：challenge levels<br>-increase：cloud storage<br>- repair：“rockfall”Bug</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The world of WENJIA is one that shifts between the realms of Matter and Energy.</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/933450/extras/switch.jpg?t=1550574420\" ><br>The realms of Matter and Energy mirror each other in perfect duality.
