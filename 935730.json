You travel by truck over the world after the zombie apocalypse. In the desert, snow-covered mountainous areas, night forests, industrial zones and destroyed cities.<br>The gameplay is very simple - drive the truck quickly or sloooooowly, bounce with a rocket engine, shoot a lot of different monsters and zombies of all sizes and colors. Destroy the bosses, save people and DO NOT rum black cats!!!<br>You can also throw grenades and call support from the air. For killing zombies you get coins (how it can be without coins!?!), for which you can buy new weapons and upgrades. All game objects in the game are physical. You can shoot an arm, a leg, a head or some other part of the monster. There are many awards in the game, if you get everything, you will receive the honorary title of &quot;Overlord&quot;, and along with it cool cannon and helmet !!!<br>In your arsenal will be: tommy gun, grenade launcher, machine gun, minigun and nominal high-speed cannon &quot;overlord&quot; (if you collect all medals of course). The weapon is characterized by lethal force, rate of fire, recharge time, bullet flight speed and store volume.<br>There are many and many monsters and zombies !!! Some of them are too funny, some are too sad, too scary and surreal .... And some of them are very similar to the characters you know))",
