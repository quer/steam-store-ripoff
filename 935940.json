The player can knock other balls and take roquet in order to position the best winning strategy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA deadness board, scorecard, and diagram of the court can be viewed in the pause menu. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is played by selecting a move (i.e. strike the ball, switch balls, let balls lie and end turn) then selecting the court to position the mallet. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nReleasing the press will fire the mallet from the indicated position with a power related to the distance from the ball. For the starting turns and when taking roquet, the balls is placed by selecting within the purple line or circle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the seasoned croquet player to the novice, Croquet Pro 2 is a unique and fun game unlike any other.",
