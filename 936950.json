Your goal is to conquer the map by taking over colored tiles. To take any tile your colors must be the same, and that tile need to be adjacent to your other tiles. In 'Skirmish' mode you can play with up to 4 players and AI with 3 difficulty levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plus or minus</h2>Fast logic game, based on the original concept, slightly related to mathematics, more focused on planning and strategic approach. 5 game modes (Skirmish, Negation, Stars, Stars+, Hastag), in 'Skirmish' mode you can play with up to 4 players and AI with 3 difficulty levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Twisted Line</h2>Turn all dark tiles into light tiles by drawing a single line, that's it! Pick up keys to unlock blocked tiles, use special blocks to pass harder levels. Game includes 12 hand made levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Colorful Ribbons</h2>Cover all tiles with properly colored ribbons. Various ribbons can interweave, each of them marks tiles of same color as covered. Game includes 18 hand made levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tetriles</h2>Best classic if you have some spare time. Simple graphic with 3 art styles for blocks and responsive controls.",
