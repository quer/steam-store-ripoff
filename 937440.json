Your goal is to solve strange disappearances and to forestall a calamity about to beset the world. You will journey from New York City to Greece, Egypt, Germany, and Antarctica.<br><br>Beginning with the theft of a priceless relic, four friends are drawn one by one into a dark web of mystery and horror.

There are four ready-made investigators provided for this purpose, enabling you to take on differing roles as circumstances change in your search for the truth: Louis Grunewald, a linguistics professor from the Miskatonic University, Lydia Lau, a story-seeking reporter for the New York Sun, Devon Wilson, a sailor on leave from the US Navy, and Ernest Holt, a wealthy industrialist.<br><br>This adventure is guaranteed dangerous. But, no matter how skillfully you avoid death or madness, your investigators will fail if they do not prevent the turning of the world and the freeing of the City of the Old Ones from the ice.<br><br>Armed with a copy of the Call of Cthulhu Keepers Rulebook, a pencil, and some roleplaying dice you are all set for the twists and turns of this epic world spanning adventure.
