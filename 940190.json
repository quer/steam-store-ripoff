There’s over 35 levels to complete, including new bonus stage levels that are exclusive to this edition of the game. Each level is a tricky mix of platform action with ladders, elevators, enemies and more. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd watch out because just as you think you have everything mastered, Bertha, Harry's arch enemy will join in and she's not friendly to Harry's egg collecting antics! In fact, she's is not going to stop chasing him until she’s put an end to Harry once and for all! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce you've got a few levels under your belt, try one of the other game modes. There's Hard mode that offers a real challenge for even the hardiest of platform warriors. Or, there's Survivor Run: See how far you can get on just one life and try for an 'A' Grade score. It's quite a bit harder than it sounds. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd if that's not enough, Time Trial mode turns Chuckie Egg 2017 into a full-on speed-run competition.
