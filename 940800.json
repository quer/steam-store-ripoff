            "detailed_description": "All the people of Gnomeland were preparing for a double celebration – Christmas alongside the triumphant coronation of the princess. Preparations marched on day and night in the castle courtyard. A troll lived nearby, and the constant sawing and hammering disturbed his rest. Angered, he and his henchmen stole the Christmas tree. The old gnome Elvenar brought this news to the princess while she was sipping lemonade and redesigning the landscape to make it look more Christmassy. <br />\r\n“What do you think, Elvenar, should I redesign the garden, or should I focus more on the main square? On the one hand the townspeople can have picnics with their neighbors in the garden, neighborhood games, walk their dogs, and I’d be able to go there with my pussy cat. On the other hand, the main party will be in the square...”<br />\r\n“Your highness, about that – the people are greatly disturbed by the theft of the main Christmas tree and all the gifts from the square!”<br />\r\n“What!? Who dared to do that?”<br />\r\nThen the princess swore to return what was stolen and set off with her loyal friends in search of the Christmas thieves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour loyal subjects need your help! Join the heroine and her friends on a new adventure through incredible places: a crystal cave, a village of tribal fishermen and many others! Secrets, mystical creatures, mysterious events – all this awaits you in the exciting casual fantasy strategy Gnome Garden: Christmas Story.
