            "detailed_description": "An advanced environmental simulation program called Earth-5 has predicted that there are only five years remaining before irreversible ecological damage caused by industrialisation, pollution and the overuse and destruction of natural resources will cause the Earth’s demise. The Eden Initiative, of which this mission is the major part, is a project aimed at saving Earth from this Armageddon. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe key to this is the rare mineral iridium oxide, found on the harsh alien planet AJ3905. AJ3905 is a world accessible only through an interplanetary device called the Quantum Gate and the mission involves a series of mining expeditions to extract the mineral and bring it back to Earth. However, AJ3905's hellish atmosphere consists of a poisonous, caustic gas that promises an agonising death for unprotected humans which requires the wearing of a protective suit (known as a 'Tophat').<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFurthermore, it is occupied by a hostile life form that appear as frighteningly skeletal anthropomorphic forms through the Tophat's virtual reality display. It is the role of the player and his fellow army recruits to protect the scientific mining crew during their repeated forays to the planet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the original interactive movie created by Hyperbole Studios in 1993 and published by the now defunct Media Vision Technology. P2B Gaming have obtained permission to remake the title as well as use original game assets from the original author Greg Roach.",
