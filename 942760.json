            "detailed_description": "Are you a drift master? Prove your skills in Burnout Drift! Drift to get a high score and earn coins; the longer your drift the higher the coins you earn. Be careful not to crash when performing a drift or your accumulated scores are gone. Use the coins that you earn to customize your car or to buy new cars!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBurnout Drift is a true drifting challenge and a great game for those who love car racing. Before taking to the track and racing, you can first customize your vehicle – you can adjust the suspension and body angle etc to suit your driving style. Furthermore, you can also customize your cars paint job and alloy style. You can practice your drifting on three different tracks – each feature different weather conditions and road layouts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe layouts feature some awesome hairpin turns and long sweeping bends that you can gracefully drift around. You score points for each successful drift you complete, and the longer the drift, the more points you earn. Your score multiplier increases the longer you drift for, but it resets if you hit the sides of the road so be careful! Coins you earn during a race can be used afterwards to upgrade your vehicle and to purchase new and more powerful super cars. Can you become a drifting legend in this sequel of Burnout Drift? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDrift crazily through turns at incredible speeds and show others how it is done. You can show off on the track how you want, but what is really behind it? Great effort of mechanics and ideal car setup for a unique driving experience. When you visit the garage, you will find out that you can do virtually anything with your car. Do you wish to adjust the engine power, braking ratio or steering sensitivity? Each pro will has his own style, but most games will not allow you to complexly modify the cars behavior. This is not the case of Burnout Drift, which offers these options, so you can enjoy a unique ride to your liking. Think and experiment with different vehicle settings to find the ideal &quot;setup&quot; that will allow you to drift in the best possible way. A crazy drifting challenge is waiting for you! Have fun.",
