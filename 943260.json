As the son/daughter of the gravely injured captain you take charge and set up a camp for the survivors. Since food resources are limited you plant your own crops and establish a small farm. Your goal is to eventually build a new ship. So you search all islands for useful treasures and forage deeper and deeper into the wilderness. On your excursions many exciting quests await you – as well as numerous dangers and threats. Will you solve the secret of the cursed islands? It's the only way to escape. Awaken the adventurer deep inside!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">farming &amp; the Crew</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/943260/extras/farming_steam.gif?t=1550841356\" ><br>Set up a survivors' camp and find food resources.
