The Fiefs were divided into two Realms, separated by a great chasm.

A disagreement between the North and South caused the champion of the North, the Blitz Mage, to attack the South. The South had its own champion: the Old Codger, who bravely fought back. Although the South put up a valiant fight, all was lost when the Blitz Mage seized control of all 10 pieces of The Conductrex – a powerful magical artifact.

He reached his enemy and the two fought – but the Blitz Mage won. Gravely wounded, the Old Codger still managed to break apart the Conductrex once again, spreading its pieces across The Island.
