IRL yelling and excitement may occur, in this ultimate two-player showdown of fast-paced fencing and melee attacks. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeware, advantages in Nidhogg are often fleeting, as new opponents continually spawn in your way.  Use a variety of fencing maneuvers while armed -- lunges, parries, and even dirty tricks like throwing your sword.  If swordless, press forward with punches, sweep kicks, dive kicks, rolls, and wall jumps. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe combat arena stretches in both directions, although besting an opponent only gains you ground. Matches aren’t won or lost with a single kill, but with a series of kills granting you right-of-way to run/fight/flee to your own goal-zone. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach arena holds different strategic formations and chokepoints to use to your advantage.  Until you reach your goal-zone, anything is possible. Only one thing is certain in Nidhogg… the only way to win is to outwit your opponent. En Garde!",
