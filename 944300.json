With its distinctive gameplay and state of the art vector graphics projected over a raster display, it quickly became a major hit. In 1979 more quarters were dropped in the coin boxes of Byte Driver than all of that year’s other machines put together.    <br><br>Sadly, the combination display was notoriously failure prone and arcade operators found their upkeep difficult. By 1981 the last known Byte Driver machine went offline. Since then the whole craze has been largely forgotten.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is Byte Driver?</h2>  <br><br>Byte Driver combines a classic driving game with a bottom up shooter. Your car runs on energy. Energy and weapons are obtained by hacking the vehicles around you. You’ll have to stay alert, because the sharply twisting road and countless enemy vehicles will be trying to stop you from reaching your ultimate goal. Run out of energy, and you die.   <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/944300/extras/BD_HACK_1.gif?t=1549989071\" ><br><br>If you're thinking this sounds like “a hard game”, you're right. Byte Driver is designed to push your reflexes to the limit. You'll be competing with drivers from around the world for the top spots on the leaderboards. The best drivers will even be able to earn a physical patch commemorating their achievement.  <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/944300/extras/BD_FIGHT_1.gif?t=1549989071\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">But Don't Stress! </h2>If you're thinking you can't do it, that's where you’re wrong. Vector Hat knows not all players like to be punished by their games, and that's why there will be a No Stress Mode where your energy never depletes.
