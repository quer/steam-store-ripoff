A first of its kind 4x game combining both full planetary and galactic gameplay.<br><br><strong><i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">State of the Game</h2><br>(October 11, 2018)<br><br>The current state of the game is what we would describe as Initial Early Access.  The game is certainly playable, though you will come across bugs and may even struggle at times to figure what certain things in the game do.  These are quickly being addressed on a near daily basis, if not more often. <br><br>While we do have internal play-testers that are helping with the further development of Xenia’s Ark, we have decided to open up to Early Access so that we can get feedback from a larger pool of people and computer set-ups.  If you are looking for a complete game with minimal bugs that can easily be played from start to finish, we would encourage you to put Xenia’s Ark on your wishlist and check back when we have the game closer to full release.  However, if you want to be part of the process, help with finding bugs, and give constructive feedback, we would love for you to be part of the game and see how it develops into a full-release game.  <br><br>Even in this Initial Early Access state, Xenia’s Ark still has some fun and interesting gameplay, depth and strategy, and full planetary and full galactic gameplay.  We believe this is an exciting time for Malicious Games and the strategy and 4X genre as a whole as we continue to pursue the goal of providing a first of its kind 4X game.<br><br>We look forward to hearing your feedback.

The effects had been storied in lore as the blessings of the gods in the form of auroras that covered entire planets and dark omens by the strange disappearance of stars.  But in the past couple of centuries, the effects of the gravitational waves (G-Waves) produced by the twin black holes had grown ever more destructive across the entire galaxy.  Planets had their orbits altered to the point of making them uninhabitable, or even put on collision course with other planets.<br><br>A representative from each empire in the galaxy was sent to meet on the home planet of the Phaedon Empire — an empire renown for science, prosperity, and peace.  A century earlier, the very same hall had seen an end to the Great Chaos War that had engulfed the entire galaxy for nearly two centuries.  Now it would host the empires as they sought a means of mutual survival as the entire galaxy is under imminent threat of destruction by foes they cannot fight.  After many days of questions, ideas, and debate, the empires unanimously agreed to abandon the only galaxy they had called home and sojourn to places unknown in order that their empires may live on.<br><br>It was estimated that the galaxy would be uninhabitable, if not outright destroyed, in no more than 50 years.  The Phaedon had recently developed wormhole technology that would allow travel to the farthest stretches of the universe in a matter of moments. This new and untested technology would be the means by which the races would survive and live on elsewhere.  The empires, united by this cause, diverted all resources to the development of the technology, scouting of the universe, and the building of the Great Arks that would transport the empires to their new foreign homes.<br><br>The empires met again after new galaxies had been scouted.  They debated, argued, wrangled, and finally settled on a new galaxy to reestablish their empires.  An ancient Phaedon word for “hospitality” — generosity and courtesy shown to those who are far from home — was chosen as the name for their new home.   It would be known as Xenia.<br><br>You have been appointed leader of the Great Ark of your people.  The day you have yearned for and dreaded is here as your Ark sets a heading for the wormhole.  The fear and hope of your people weigh heavily on you as you consult the star charts and maps of the planets that await you on the other side.  The Great Ark approaches the coordinates for staging before the launch through the wormhole, when a giant G-Wave hits your ship.  Sensors detect at least another three or four in its wake.
