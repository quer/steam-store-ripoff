The game’s story required that kind of approach, since the very adventurous and joyful life of the main boy and girl characters, has been interrupted by an invasion of sinister robots. The game, My Memory of Us, is inspired by the tragic events of the holocaust during World War II. Music blends the plot, before and during the war, by using traditional and electronic sounds to portray the storyline and to follow the narration. The soundtrack album contains most of the music from the game.
