His minions, the Lairg, are one of the meanest enemies of the Academy. The Lairg mean to invade and destroy everything on their path, but unbeknownst to them, three young hunters have evaded the petrification (by skipping class by the way).<br><br>Seeing the attack and using their combat prowess, the three hunters face the Lairg, becoming the last and unlikely hope of the Dealain Academy.</i><br><br><strong>Hunter's Trial: The fight never ends</strong> is a turn-based tactical RPG inspired by great classics like Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem. Players take control of Shaw, Jade and Gisli, the three worst students of the magical Dealain Academy, facing the evil and mighty Lairg lizards in tactical battles. Along five game stages, players will need to prepare the decks of magic cards that the hunters will use in their battles. Each character has a different set of cards that represent their combat abilities, allowing players to customize each deck to their will. As the hunters progress in the story, new cards will be unlocked.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters</h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/945850/extras/Shaw_Heroes.png?t=1544615148\" ><br><strong>Shaw</strong><br>Gender: Male<br>Age: 18<br>Traits: Bravado, overconfident, egocentric.<br><br>Shaw is quite an egotistical character, although he is ready to take a hit if the need arises.
