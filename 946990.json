            "detailed_description": "Introducing Secret Government – a game in the genre of turn-based strategy about a secret society that has been ruling humankind from the shadows for hundreds of years. And that is the main feature of the game: you’re going to lead not just a country, as is usually the case, but the organization dominating the whole world: The Brotherhood.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou’ll be planting your agents in various realms; and infiltrating institutions of authority in order to exploit their resources and seize control over decision makers. You are about to make history from XVII century to the present day. In every mission you will be involved in the main conflict of a certain time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Chapter I you’re going to:<br />\r\n· incite the War of Independence and ensure the victory of the USA;<br />\r\n· start the French War and bring the republicans to power;<br />\r\n· reshape Europe in the time of the Napoleonic Wars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ultimate goal of the Brotherhood will gradually unfold as the story develops. You realize that it’s not just about wealth and power. The Brotherhood seeks to reconstruct the whole world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn this path you’ll confront a hostile secret organization. Their methods are similar to yours but the goals are very different, and you’ll have to find out what they’re after. You need to act slowly and cautiously so that the awareness of your influence doesn’t increase too much otherwise you’ll be exposed and at risk of losing your hard-earned level of infiltration in the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will have more than 50 diplomatic, economic and military operations at your disposal. Keep monitoring the domestic politics of each country! If the ideology of the party in power is very different from the views of various social classes, if the taxes are too high and the level of public order is too low – expect a revolution. Although, maybe that’s exactly what you were trying to achieve?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery country leader weighs up the risks and benefits of increasing taxes, starting wars, threats of revolution and so on. They strive to maintain the status quo and follow the rules of their epoch. All they care about is strengthening their power, preserving their territories, and the opportunity to advance both. You’ll need to find a way to destabilize the system and trigger the crisis, which will bring the desired changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, you won’t be able to impose your will on the leaders – your influence in the game is indirect. You can’t just tell a monarch to declare war on the neighboring country, but what you can do is plant your agents in the countries you need, provoke the deterioration of relations and make one of the parties believe in a<br />\r\nfast-approaching profitable victory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe hope that you spend many enjoyable hours absorbed in exploring the mechanisms of the world with Secret Government. Support this campaign and join the Brotherhood!",
