The brutal system based on denunciations, threats, and the lack of trust quickly developed and became overwhelming. There was no more room for truth. Each and every person could be accused, sentenced, tortured, and forced to work in inhumane conditions. The system, which was later on expanded by Stalin and called the Gulag, spread quickly, devouring not only millions of innocent individuals, but even entire nations. People were forced to work in mines and at taiga logging. They frequently died due to unbearable hunger, illnesses, unfavorable weather conditions, supervisor brutality, and inmate cruelty. The ones trying to escape were beaten to death by officers, betrayed by the inhabitants of nearby settlements, killed by wild animals,  extreme cold and hunger. Is it possible to survive and find motivation to become free in such conditions? Is it possible for hungry and devastated prisoners to travel thousands of miles of endless taiga, grasslands, and deserts, struggling with the untamed wilderness, avoiding patrols, and escaping untrustworthy citizens in order to reach a safe zone?
