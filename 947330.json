Now you can!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo on a flight in a hot air balloon over the entire now-vanished ancient city. See how the Rome Reborn team of archaeologists and 3D technicians has, over the last 22 years, painstakingly brought the city’s thousands of buildings back to life, learn about the famous seven hills and other natural features, and find out how the ancient Romans lived, governed and provisioned themselves, took time off for recreation, and worshiped their gods. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSee the Forum, Colosseum, aqueducts, theater district, the imperial fora, the Circus Maximus, the imperial palace, the tombs of Augustus and Hadrian, the Pyramid of Cestius, and much, much more. The app has more than 30 points of interest and over two hours of content. You can organize your tour with complete freedom. As you move from point to point, you can listen to expert commentary about what you are seeing. You will see the city in a way that not even the ancient Romans could do--the hot air balloon was only invented in 1950 (we did use the word &quot;magic,&quot; didn't we?). In no time, you will have a degree of familiarity with this greatest of ancient cities that only a handful of experts could claim to have after a lifetime of study. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe application is the perfect place to begin enjoying the many applications that the Rome Reborn team is creating. The other applications take you down to ground level and present a specific area of the city—for example, the Roman Forum, the Colosseum district, or the imperial palace. The Flight over Rome brings it all together and shows you how the individual buildings and monuments fit into a larger pattern of urban organization. Once you get the big picture from this application, we are certain that your appetite for going down to ground level and exploring the individual monuments will be whetted. Your awareness of the endless variety of Rome’s monuments will be raised. Your curiosity will be aroused. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen, after you have explored the other applications on the ground, you’ll want to go back up into the air to see how what at first seemed a jumbled mass of buildings—there are over 7,000 of them!—is starting to come into focus. In short, the Flight over Rome is not something to use just once. Like a great book, it repays repeated visits. The more you use it, especially in conjunction with our other applications, the more you will get out of it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you have finished your flight over the city, register in the Rome Reborn Community on our website, gauge your level of expertise, and see how you stack up against other users.

I have followed the development of Rome Reborn VR since its inception in the 1990s. Now that the first VR applications of the project are starting to appear in online stores, I am delighted to express my strong support for this unique initiative which combines archaeological accuracy with state-of-the-art technology. The goal is to make the core monuments of the Eternal City easily comprehensible even to non-experts, and to bring ancient Rome into the homes and schools of people wherever they may be. In my opinion, the Rome Reborn VR team has brilliantly achieved this goal. --Prof. Paolo Liverani”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo, University of Florence (Italy)</a><br><br>“As Director of the Civic Museum of Rieti, about 80 km north of Rome, on Saturday, May 26, 2018 I organized, at the museum, two public demonstrations of the Rome Reborn VR application presenting the Roman Forum. Over 100 people of all ages attended both demonstrations. I can report that the response was enthusiastically positive. The event showed that Rome Reborn VR has the potential to make the study of history come alive for students and the general public. Rome Reborn VR is a great tool for the museum world and for anyone around the world who wants to learn more about ancient Rome by going back in time to visit the city as it appeared at the peak of its development in AD 320. --Dr. Monica De Simone”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Civic Museum of Rieti (Italy)</a><br><br>“This is an *amazing* pedagogical tool with lots of applications in secondary and higher education. As a professor of Classics, I consider Roman Reborn VR an indispensable tool for courses on Roman civilization, Roman history, Roman archaeology, even Latin literature. While this app has a lot to offer to faculty and students, it will also appeal to non-academics who are interested in ancient Rome. --Prof. Zoe Stamatopoulou”<br>5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/romerebornvr/reviews/?ref=page_internal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Department of Classics, Washington University (USA)</a><br>",
