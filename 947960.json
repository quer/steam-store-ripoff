Magic boxes containing bonuses will be appearing in random places on track all the time! Those can be collected to improve your car capabilities, such as increased maximum speed and acceleration or additional energy points, which can be spend to use cars special powers.

It is these elements, deviating from realism, and original, imaginative tracks that are the main strengths of this game.<br>Because I'm not a specialist on computer networking, Ribbon Racer doesn't have multiplayer online mode.
