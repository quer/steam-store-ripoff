We shared a vision for a difficult, retro, gritty fantasy game inspired by the 16-bit era. As each semester led to the next, we continued to work on Wizard Prison as we knew we had something worth sharing. We were excited to do our finishing touches, eventually add a true final boss, and release Wizard Prison to the public for some nominal price tag. As time went on, however, it became clear that life post-graduation would take the team on separate paths. Paying the bills would take priority, and those finishing touches would never happen. After multiple attempts to revive Wizard Prison to no avail, we collectively decided to release our most recent build, playable from start to finish, for everybody to enjoy free of charge. We hope you will enjoy escaping Wizard Prison as much as we enjoyed creating it.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>Art<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>16-bit style<br></li><li>Modern dynamic lighting<br></li><li>Top-down perspective</li></ul>Interface<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>&quot;Twin stick&quot; control with WASD and mouse<br></li><li>Auto map</li></ul>Sound<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Retro-style SFX<br></li><li>Dynamic, real-time BGM</li></ul>Game<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Non-linear action/exploration gameplay<br></li><li>Five main spells plus one bonus spell-- can you find it?<br></li><li>Exploding barrels!</li></ul>",
