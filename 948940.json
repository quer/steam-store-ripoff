Taking advantage of being in Virtual Reality, Rubik’s Cube™ VR’s professional narrator will guide you through the tips and tricks to solving the Cube in 3D, turning and twisting the virtual Cube as you learn. Complete beginners start with one side of the Cube, while advanced solvers can enjoy the unique ways Rubik’s Cube™ VR makes solving a difficult challenge! Can you solve the Cube blindfolded? Perhaps in environments riddled with distractions? <i>Can you break the World Record of 4.74 seconds?</i><br>Compete with other players or challenge your friends to a Rubik’s Cube™ Showdown! Use fun distractions to break their concentration and win!<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game modes</h2></strong><br><i><strong>Learning mode</strong></i><br><br>Virtual Reality is the perfect place to teach players how to solve the Rubik's Cube™. Replacing the difficulty of 2D representations with the ease of being able to see the Cube in full 3D help to understand solving immediately and intuitively.<br>The game starts off by teaching the basics for complete beginners or with more advanced algorithms for skilled players. The game analyzes the moves made by the player, in order to offer better ways of solving and improve skills even if the player is experienced in solving the Cube.<br>Focus on moves you haven’t mastered yet and skip moves you know. The learning experience is tailored to your preference.<br>The game can help solving the Cube by showing the actual tiles with blinking colors, rotating circles around it, so the player can see where to focus. Players can see where to turn the Cube because of big glowing arrows showing the way, thus learning is really intuitive and easy to understand.<br><br><i><strong>Competitive 1v1 mode</strong></i><br><br>Solve the same shuffled Cube in a race against another player. Distract your opponent by shaking their Cube, locking a tile for a few seconds, or just turning the Cube around in their hand randomly.<br><br><i><strong>Quick Play</strong></i><br><br>Solve the official shuffling for the Cube, used by the World Cube Association. Rubik’s Cube™ VR will remember the time and moves you made to offer better solutions in Learning mode. <br><br><i><strong>Relax mode</strong></i><br><br>Solve the Cube at a leisurely pace, without the distraction of a clock. Listen to relaxing music and choose between a nice beach, a forest, a mountaintop or other various beautiful and peaceful imageries.<br><br><i><strong>Challenge mode</strong></i><br><br>Similarly to Quick play, solve the official Cube but the main focus is on time. Choose between playing against your own time or your friends’ records. Challenge the world record; Rubik’s Cube™ VR notifies you after 4.22 seconds.",
