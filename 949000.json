Points are scored through dominating a single capture zone per round with each zone providing a unique challenge to the teams. <br>Players can pick up to 4 abilities which can be used to throw opponents, save allies or beat enemies out of the capture zone. Picking the right combination of abilities with your team can be the difference between victory and defeat. <br><br>The environment features different types of interactive and animated elements that can launch, carry, fire, bounce your marble for better or for worse.<br>Learn the environment through single player time attack challenges .<br><br>The rough road map for Marble Combat will be to go to Steam Early Access with the main map and game mode.
