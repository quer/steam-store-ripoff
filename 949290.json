You will deal with the day-to-day business as the shop owner while you unlock new things that will help you run a lucrative enterprise.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949290/extras/Shopkeeper324.gif?t=1550831184\" ><br>As the shopkeeper of your very own shop you are in charge of buying, selling, and making a profit. Items can be bought from passing traders or delivered at a fee. Items can be placed on displays in order to sell them to customers. When you are ready, you can open your shop to start the day and let customers in. Customers will buy what you have on display if it matches what they are looking for. If you don't provide what a customer wants in time, they will be sad and leave. A day of shopkeeping can be stressful but rewarding!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949290/extras/Shopkeeper325.gif?t=1550831184\" ><br>Bring out your interior designer by freely placing and rotating all furniture or use snapping if inaccuracy drives you nuts. Furniture comes in a variety of categories. There are displays which let you display items to sell in your shop. Decorations will make your shop more appealing and increase the amount of customers that come to your shop. You can increase the item stock capacity by placing storage type furniture. With crafting type furniture you can produce items to sell in your shop.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949290/extras/Shopkeeper326.gif?t=1550831184\" ><br>When you have amassed enough money you can decide to expand your shop. The shop building is tile based where you decide what floor to place and what walls surround each tile. Walls can also be windows, archways, or doors. Expanding will also make your shop more appealing to customers as each piece makes your shop more appealing. With each wall type has a matching entrance to really tie the place together.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949290/extras/Shopkeeper327.gif?t=1550831184\" ><br>Crafting lets you create items that you can sell in your shop. Crafting requires resources but lets you gain experience so that you can create higher quality items than what you can get from traders. Currently you can craft tools and weapons at the forge and clothing at the tailoring station. As the game develops, more crafting options will become available.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949290/extras/Shopkeeper328.gif?t=1550831184\" ><br>In Winkeltje you can buy seeds from traders, plant seeds in planters, water plants, and harvest crops. Crops are items that you can sell in your shop. If crops aren't cared for they can wither and die.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949290/extras/Shopkeeper329.gif?t=1550831184\" ><br>As time goes by you will encounter events and seasons. Events and seasons can affect the supply and demand for certain items. It can be profitable to stock up on certain items so that you can sell them for more profit when the time is right.",
