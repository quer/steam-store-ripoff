It works at a very high level of abstraction so users can issue &quot;walk here&quot; or &quot;say this&quot; style commands. Users can then spend most of their time focusing on the story, instead of the tedious aspects of animation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe software includes a growing library of built-in objects and animations. There are text-to-speech capabilities so that users can quickly write dialogue and automate lip-syncing. A custom, high performance inverse kinematics system helps automatically generate dynamic animations and pose characters. The terrain and sky can be easily edited to support many different environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of these things together make it very fun and easy for an average user to make high quality animations. Please give it a try!",
