Players are offered a two-tier driving licence where each tier determines which car and taxi tariff are going to be available to the player. At the start of the game, all players are automatically assigned a tier 1 driving licence. This tier allows the player to use non-designated cars only, under the minimum tariff rates. A tier 2 driving licence gives players a wider choice of cars as they can use both non-designated and designated cars, and allows to charge higher tariff rates. To upgrade to a tier 2 licence, the player would need to pass a number of driving tests in the “Practice Driving” mode. Note that where a non-designated car is going to be used along with a tier 2 licence, a minimum tariff will apply. At the customer pick-up point, the estimated fare, distance, and the duration of the drive will be calculated automatically. The required destination point will be shown on the map to assist with planning the best route. This information will be made available to the player before he/she decides whether to accept the hiring. <br>Faults such as collisions, driving very slowly/too fast, driving on red light will attract a penalty deduction from the fare paid. Memory of the location, effective route planning along with accurate and efficient driving are all the keys to success in this game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Practice Driving</h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949810/extras/features3.png?t=1546615497\" ><br><br>The “Practice Driving” mode can be used to learn and practice the routes before taking a test to obtain a tier 2 taxi driving licence. The player can choose between a number of the pre-defined routes to try and memorise them. During the practice drive, the player will be assisted by a map which will have their chosen route marked with the directional arrows. The system will be capturing and processing the data from the route, such as the driver’s speed and road signs, and will trigger alerts in case of speeding, driving on red light or other driver’s faults. <br>Once in the test, the map with the route shown on it will not be accessible, and penalty points will be given for each driver’s fault. To obtain a tier 2 driving licence, the player will need to successfully complete 6 test routes of choice, with no more than 10 penalty points received for any each of them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Street Racing</h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/949810/extras/features2.png?t=1546615497\" ><br><br>Fancy a bit of a high-speed challenge? The “Street Racing” mode gives players the opportunity to use and sharpen their race-driving skills.
