It is the purchase of raw materials, the correct mixing and selling in the foreground. Thus, the game refers to the subject of \"drugs\", but does not illustrate any negative aspects of these, such as addictions or physical decline. The representation of weapons and their use is indeed present, but limited to a minimum of violence, such as excessive representation of blood."
