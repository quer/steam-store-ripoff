For example for cars, you want to research bigger and more efficient batteries, if you decide to produce electric cars, or more performant combustion engines if you want to produce gasoline or diesel based cars.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2><br>The game is running in real-time, but can be accelerated and paused at any time.
