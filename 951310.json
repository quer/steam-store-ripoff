Everything seems normal in the sea-side down, but there's whispers of a conspiracy in town. You don't want to be a stranger (even though you are). Even, so should you really be taking that trip?</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>DoVille is a VR destination with places to visit and things to try. This first chapter &quot;Juniper Beach&quot; has a mini-mystery at it's heart, but we encourage you to try all the VR rides and give us feedback during early access so we can build more for you.<br><br>You should know that we're testing this game for young and the elders. Elders don't get enough content, and we've got a bit of a &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; (an elder's show) mixed with the 1970s vibe going so they can really get into it. <br><br>From parasailing to roller-coasting, from chatting to locales to having a nice sit on a VR beach while it might be snowing outside in real life, DoVille, we hope, has a little for everyone.<br><br>Anything we try we're also building into a portable version we'll fire out to elders, so we really hope it's a hit, and only VR players in Early Access on Steam can help us do that.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DoVille </h2><br>In the land of DoVille and all through the world,<br>The Do's were amassing and having a thrill.<br>VR Rides to engage and and crime motives to prove,<br>It's low poly VR with high stakes as its groove.<br><br>Early Access here is the name of the game,<br>VR and Chill, We're not ashamed!<br>To ask you for feedback on this very joint<br>Building early access riffs is the whole Done Point.<br><br>For seekers and players we hear what you've said:<br>&quot;Please us and build us toys for our heads.&quot;<br>For the Dos down in DoVille the young and the small,<br>They're really you, and we're we and that is quite all.<br><br>_______________________________________________________<br><br>DoVille's a world with a bunch of activities and some mysteries all running in VR.
