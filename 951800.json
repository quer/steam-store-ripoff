To continue doing this, we know we need much more input from real-world users, like you.<br><br><strong>That's why we're super excited to announce that Softspace Beta is now available on the Steam Store!</strong><br><br>We have a ton of exciting features in the pipe for Softspace, which we'll be rolling out over the coming weeks and months, together with bug fixes and other improvements. By getting Softspace Beta, you'll be able to try these out before anybody else.<br><br>The full version of Softspace will be subscription-based. As a sign of our gratitude for your support at this early stage, upon Softspace's full launch, Beta users will receive half a year of the highest service tier, for free!<br><br>Please send any questions, concerns, or awesome ideas to hi@softspace.io.
