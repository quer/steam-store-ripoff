Grand Strategy will feature two modes of play: <strong>Casual</strong> and <strong>Campaign</strong>.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Casual Mode</h2><br>Grand Strategy supports Special Units, which can be deployed alongside your armies to lead them in battle.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/952090/extras/units.png?t=1546856388\" ><br><br>In <strong>Casual</strong> mode, you create, join and play games at your leisure: log in and play a real-time game with your friends. Or join a game with daily turns and work your way up the leader board. In slow play mode, you can pause games, enjoy your weekend, then come back days later and continue the game.<br><br>But if you want to play a RISK-like game as it has never been played before: join a campaign. Lead your faction to victory.<br><br>A mobile client is in development, and just like the Steam Client, it can be played for free (with no advertisements).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Campaign Mode</h2><br>Campaign Mode is under development and not yet available in the game. In <strong>Campaign</strong> mode, two factions will fight for victory in one grand war, on one large overworld map. When you join a campaign, you choose a faction. The factions control territories on the overworld map. By competing in separate games (or battles), factions gain and lose territories. Territories confer victory points, and the faction to gain the most victory points will emerge victorious.<br><br>Campaign mode is new to the board game RISK. It's never been tried before. In other turn-based strategy games, you play one game, you win or lose, and you move on to the next game. In Grand Strategy, a faction must coordinate and plan across many different games. We plan on adding different types of Campaigns all based around a series of theme based maps. The initial Campaign will be Fantasy based. Then we would like to build a World War II Campaign.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br>It might sound silly, but our goal is to build the best RISK client and user interface in the world.
