Over 15 years of experience and 6 months of development bring you a Blender training course like no other. I’ll take you through every step of the creation process for creating a Corvette Stingray, including modeling, shading, rendering, and compositing. You’ll learn all the techniques you need to know to create flawless surfaces and impressive renders.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get Perfect Curves with Advanced Modeling Techniques</h2>The biggest hassle of subsurf modeling is dealing with adding details to curved surfaces and having that additional topology ruin your smooth surfaces. In this course I’ll show you methods that bypass that problem entirely so you can maintain your perfect curves without any hassle. Not only are the results perfect, but the workflow is actually fun and much faster when you don’t have to worry about every detail affecting your surfaces. Plus one of the best benefits is total and care-free control over the resulting topology of your model.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Advanced Modifier Usage for Efficiency and Awesomeness</h2>Modifiers are so insanely powerful, and can be combined in so many ways to achieve really complex tasks. In this course you’ll learn a ton of different and unique ways to use modifiers. From general complex modeling tasks, to other things like instantly getting your windshield wipers flush against the windshield surface, we’ll be using modifiers to make our lives easier in making just about everything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shading and Rendering</h2>I’ll be showing you how to create your own customize-able car paint including metallic flakes and orange peel, and all other shaders necessary for the final renders. Then we’ll be setting up an environment to get the right lighting and reflections, and setting up some compositing nodes for a little post processing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Keep in Touch!</h2>This is an intermediate difficulty course so as long as you have some experience with blender you should be able to follow along fine. But if you need any help going through the project you can get in touch with me. Or even if you just want to share your progress or chat about the techniques!",
