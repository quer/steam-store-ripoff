Good ship design must consider hull shape for receive low drag, gun placement to get best fire cover, security viable parts from enemies fire, place enough propellers, engines to make it move fast enough etc, etc. Now it has a  growing number of over 150 construction elements.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/952240/extras/Dieselpunk_Wars_-_Gif-03.gif?t=1550080569\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Modes</strong></h2>Sandbox mode will allow to build and test multiple vehicle and spawn saved constructions as AI enemies. There are also a series of scenarios tutorials and  challenges with specific win and lose conditions and limited build budget. It will be also multiplayer, in which players can check whose vehicle is better.<br>Other interesting game mode is battle simulation, where you will be able to spawn any number of AI controlled, saved vehicles, divide they to two armies, take control on one of them or be only a observator and start a battle.<br>In later stages of early access new Campaign mode will come - big open living world from perspective of world map, with cities, ports, fraction and NPC fleets moving between them. In case of battle, forces from engaged sides will be spawned in simulation.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/952240/extras/Dieselpunk_Wars_-_Gif-09.gif?t=1550080569\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Destruction</strong></h2>Most important part of any ship is it core block, there can be only one of this type and its destruction annihilate whole vehicle and crew. Every block must have connection to core, each element have own hit points, vulnerability of fire, impact and explosion, some can be flooded or lose its lift. Each destroyed element change ship's combat capabilities, so different blocks placement can improve ship survivability and efficiency. Many neutral building and trees on map can be destruct during confrontation between mechanical steel monsters.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/952240/extras/Dieselpunk_Wars_-_Gif-04.gif?t=1550080569\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>Each weapons is separate object with own logic and physics. Before shoot they try aim with consideration of its limit and checking if they don't hit or collide with their own vehicle. Weapons types include many variant of artillery, rockets, machine guns,  flamethrowers, torpedo launchers, bombs, depth charges and radical close combat weapons.  Unique weapons is harpoon which can grab and pull enemies or pull own ship to ground to speed it up or work as anchor.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/952240/extras/Dieselpunk_Wars_-_Gif-02.gif?t=1550080569\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Physics</strong></h2>Shape and size of vehicle's hull affect its air and water drag. Ship with lots of slope angles will be faster than brick like. Some blocks generate buoyancy or lift, center of it must be balanced with center of mass.

For many blocks you can change the type of material it is made of, materials have different weights and other properties. Enemy ships can behavior different depend on weapons they have installed and their goals. They can keep distance, move on back of enemies or strive for brutal ramming.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/952240/extras/Dieselpunk_Wars_-_Gif-06.gif?t=1550080569\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Visibility</strong></h2>Each vehicle have own detection range parameter and view range in four directions depends of its size and placement od spoting elements. Game checks whether one ship see another by comparing they detect - view range and by checking line of sight.
