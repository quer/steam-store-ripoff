And tonight, the town that experienced a massacre under the Blood Eclipse centuries ago will not be letting its guests go without teaching them that lesson.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's a zombies vs humans scenario. Up to 6 players can play at a time, with up to 4 human heroes, and 2 zombie players. Each player will choose the character they'd like to play as and join or create a match! <br />\r\nYou start in an abandoned creepy house in the middle of a ghost town surrounded by forest. Once in, the humans will have a limited amount of time to search for weapons and items and try to complete the scenario objective. <br />\r\nThe zombies just need to prevent that from happening, by doing the thing they do best, eating humans (don't worry you'll have AI zombies helping you too).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNote to VR users! : The game was built to be played with just ONE tracked controller (because it was designed with mobile in mind) so just pick the left or the right controller. The selections are either done with double tapping or with swiping gestures, no picking things up like in a proper VR pc game here, sorry.",
