Each is a unique, hand-crafted and interconnected environment with its own fierce enemies and challenges to overcome.<br><br><br>To aid you in your quest and face the risks of the Labyrinth, you are equiped with the mighty Labrys: a powerful ceremonial axe of heros of old, key to unlocking the mysteries of the past. Without the Labrys by your side, you'd be doomed. <br><br><br>In each Realm you must seek one of the Five Wardens: powerful entities that will test your mettle in epic boss battles. Why they are here and what they are guarding is yours to uncover. <br><br>Overcome their challenge to prove worthy of their Blessings: fractions of an ancient ritual and key to unlocking new, upgradeable abilities.<br><br>Only then will you be ready to face the final challenge and risk saving the world.<br><br><br>The world hangs on a thread, Asterion: heed the call of the Labrys, face the Wardens, acquire their Blessings, uncover mysteries and prevent catastrophe!
