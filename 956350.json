Will you fight through the hordes of enemies, rescuing survivors along the way? Or will you quietly run alone, protecting your precious resources?  When the lights go out, and the monsters approach, it's too late to stop and turnaround. You must keep going. There is...no turning back. <br><br>After waking up in a world overrun by monsters you must decide what kind of survivor you are. With the choice to fight back or evade, you will endure dwindling resources and ever-persistent enemies.
