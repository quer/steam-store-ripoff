Explore the city and make new friends, solving puzzles and revealing secrets the city hides.<br><br>Far over the vast blue ocean rises a small, quiet, unremarkable city.<br>One fine evening, Leslie finds himself at the station of this city, completely losing memories of his past. On the platform, the mysterious girl Neny Ryn meets him, informing him that he is an exchange student at a local university.<br>In an effort to find out who he was before, Leslie meets many interesting personalities. Many of them share Leslie’s desire to learn more about himself, and some even become his friends. However, the strangeness that Leslie encounters in the very first days of his stay in the city makes him doubt not only whether they are friends, but even the nature of his own mind.<br>Who are they really? Which of them is lying, and who is telling the truth? And is it true that everyone in our world is entitled to a second chance?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FEATURES:</strong></h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>UNIQUE VISUAL STYLE:</strong></h2><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/958720/extras/header-bg-animation_v5.jpg?t=1542961641\" ><br>Author's visual style by the unsurpassed artist Eliana-Asato fills the game in all its aspects.
