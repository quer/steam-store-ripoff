You start off as a poor unskilled blacksmith, but in time you will gain experience and improve to achieve wealth, fame and power, and change this world!<br><br><strong><i>Fantasy Blacksmith</i></strong> is a magically realistic blacksmith simulator in which you have to create and sell weapons. Also, your smith will gain more experience and become stronger and more accurate with each created sword. You can also improve your equipment in the smithy, buy a better forge, better grindstone, improve your hammer and etc. We want to create an exciting and interesting simulator in which any player can make his dream sword. ;) We are developing the game and creating 3D models from scratch. From the finished content, we take the textures and effects, and then we rework most of them.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/959520/extras/tenbilvar.png?t=1550615030\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">&quot;You are a smith and you create swords!&quot;</h2><br> The creation of the sword begins with the drawing. The sword consists of 8 parts: Blade (5 parts), Cross-guard, Handle, Top. You choose the material from which the sword will be made. It can be iron, bronze, titan, tungsten, mithril, silver, gold, etc. Using the large number of options offered and your imagination, you can create a huge number of unique swords.
