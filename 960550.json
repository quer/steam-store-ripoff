Distress will make you laugh, and it will also make you uncomfortable. Tread carefully, and remember, the pink creatures don’t shoot acid: it’s the green ones!”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://rpgamer.com/2018/09/adventure-corner-distress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >RPGamer</a><br><br>“Something as simple as deciding whether or not to walk down a street gave me access to at least five different endings. Few games that have branching narratives have made me feel like there was real diversity and consequence to my decisions outside maybe three or four main outcomes, but Distress managed to keep me in genuine suspense to see what would happen if I chose a different path.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.yourgeekygalpal.com/review-distress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Your Geeky Gal Pal</a><br>",
