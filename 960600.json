With the aid of some of the most powerful weapons technology has to offer, you must fight your way through the storage facility and take down the nanobot central brain, deep within the heart of the facility. It won't be easy, as you will be under constant surveillance from the central brain, which will be sending any and all available resources at you at all times. You must fight your way through the levels, room by room, until you reach and destroy the central brain. In true roguelite fashion, death means death, so if you fail, you will be sent back to the beginning of the first level, so be careful!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNanoswarm is a hardcore super roguelite, designed to be very difficult. There's a survival mode that lets you keep track of your skill progression as you practice. The story, (roguelite), mode is where the real difficulty lies. You have to work through five levels with ever-increasing difficulty, without dying even once. Once you die, you're taking back to the menu screen. If you like uber-hard challenges Nanoswarm is the game for you! If not, well, there's no harm in trying, right?",
