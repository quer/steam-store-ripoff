New characters will attempt to join your crew, and it will be in your hands to provide shelter, water, and food in exchange for their skills. Each character that joins will have their own unique story, helping you understand what led them to end up without a home. By working together, you will be able to provide shelter and facilities to improve the life of your community. This will involve farming and researching technologies to improve the way you generate food and resources.<br><br>Common’hood has been inspired by the Maker Movement and all DIY initiatives that attempt to take re-claim production with a hands-on approach. In Common’hood you will be able to design furniture, Tiny Homes, Architecture, farming rigs and all sorts of structures to improve your way of living. Nothing will be standard, all can be customized to your needs.<br><br><strong>Blueprints:</strong><br><br>Common’hood uses a powerful grouping system that we call ‘Blueprints’. By grouping elements into blueprints, you will be able to automate construction or request it to be built by your community workers. Blueprints are the cornerstone of how Common’hood allows you to grow a catalog of modular creations that could become amazing constructions. Blueprints are also the main online sharing format allowing players to download creations by others.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/962090/extras/ONLINEMARKET2.gif?t=1540946923\" ><br><strong>Marketplace (Online):</strong><br><br>Common’hood will offer a marketplace for player’s creations. You will be able to share your work in a ‘creative commons’ format, increasing your reputation and attracting skilled new members, or you can sell your creations getting the resources you will need to buy machines or parts that you might be missing.
