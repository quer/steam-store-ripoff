Whereas before, you’d be idly driving along, sure of what you could manage, Special Transport adds a certain apprehension to looking at your truck’s GPS, wondering when that chill straight line will veer into tight turns and bottlenecks, and wondering if you will be able to squeeze through, or end up paying a bucket-load of fines for unintended collisions with things.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://geeksyndicate.co.uk/games/game-review-american-truck-simulator-special-transport-dlc-pc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Geek Syndicate</a><br><br>“And finally, we now get the amazing Special Transport DLC for ATS. Something that ETS2 players have been playing for a few months already, it now makes its way across the pond. It's not for the faint of heart as the cargos are also much heavier, they are also much longer and much wider, making it very difficult to maneuver; it's why the escort vehicles are there. It's quite a bit more difficult then any other cargo and any kind of damage will ruin a perfect delivery, all the road must be used when making turns and driving on back roads. Overall a very well done DLC, just as SCS has done in the past.”<br>8.3/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.game-debate.com/news/26049/warning-wide-load-special-transports-come-to-american-truck-simulator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game-Debate</a><br>",
