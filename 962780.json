When the party is asked by the local sage to collect some rare flora, it feels like relatively easy money; a journey into the woods they've traveled before, a conversation with someone they've met before and then on to gather the crop.

Deals have to be struck, foes defeated, anger and scorn dealt with and then the whole process gone through again. When there is duplicity at every turn and double-crossing is done with relish, the PCs have to keep their wits and weapons equally sharp.
