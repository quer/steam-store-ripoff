Your main enemies are zombies who already control the world - they are everywhere, in many different kinds and - most importantly - in great numbers. You will be using guns with different ammo, grenades or melee weapons to dispose of them and you will be able to heal yourself with medkits and food. As you complete more and more quests, your character will become stronger with better equipment, enhanced skills and gained perks.
