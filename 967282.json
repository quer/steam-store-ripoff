And now the transcontinental railroad, along with all its steam-era, “Old West” appeal and challenges, comes to Train Simulator with Smokebox’s extraordinary Promontory Summit route!<br><br>In the 1860s, the Central Pacific (later to become the Southern Pacific) and Union Pacific built east from Sacramento and west from Omaha respectively, with each road energized by the promise of financial rewards and government land grants based upon the miles of road they each constructed. In April 1869 it was agreed that the point of bonding of America’s transcontinental rails would be at the summit of Utah’s Promontory Range. And thus, at 12:47 p.m. on May 10, 1869, the Central Pacific and Union Pacific rails were joined with the historic “Golden Spike” ceremony, with Union Pacific 4-4-0 No. 119 and Central Pacific’s “Jupiter” standing pilot-to-pilot at Promontory Summit.<br><br>The Train Simulator Promontory Summit route re-creates the historic stage over which this remarkable railroad drama occurred, with 68 route miles extending from Corinne, Utah over Promontory Summit and along the north shore of the Great Salt Lake to Kelton, Utah. Set in 1869, the route is a remarkable Train Simulator re-creation of 19th century American railroading and its “Old West” environment. Rugged, remote topography, tough grades, spindly trestles, and the rough-and-tumble “tent towns” that dotted the newly constructed transcontinental line all come to enthralling life in the Smokebox route. Centered on Promontory Summit, the route includes segments of the railroad as originally operated by Central Pacific and Union Pacific, and thus provides a perfect and authentic setting to put Smokebox’s popular period steam power – which includes Central Pacific’s 4-4-0 “Jupiter,” CP’s 4-6-0 “Buffalo,” and Union Pacific’s 4-4-0 No. 119 types (all available separately) – to work toting passengers and freight.<br><br>Along with the beautifully crafted route, this Add-On includes ten career scenarios and three free-roam scenarios in which you can go to work at the throttle of CP and UP vintage steam power. And among the career scenarios are two scenarios which together provide an end-to-end “guided tour” of the route and its legendary history!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios</h2><br>Ten captivating and challenging career scenarios for the Promontory Summit route are included as well as three free roam scenarios.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>C01.
