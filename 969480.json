It’s not packed with carrot on a stick incentives, slowly feeding you endorphin boosts until the next piece of candy. It’s just pure, simple and fun. It is extremely challenging but fair in its difficulty and keeps you coming back for more.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://gideonsgaming.com/2019/01/04/discoverindies-warp-glider/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gideon's Gaming</a><br>",
