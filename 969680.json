Become one of our very first players and sign up here: <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.playsteelcircus.com/AlphaTest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://www.playsteelcircus.com/AlphaTest</a> We look forward to seeing you in-game and hearing your valuable feedback! Stay tuned for upcoming announcements.</p><br><h1>FAQ</h1><p><strong>When will the game launch?</strong><br>Currently our goal is to enter Early Access on Steam early next year.<br><br><strong>What is the current status of development?</strong><br>Steel Circus is currently in pre-alpha, meaning production of the game and content is still ongoing. In this stage of production, you can expect regular updates and changes to core mechanics of the game, new features introduced and tested, as well as a noticeable amount of instability and bugs, which we are addressing and improving thanks to the valuable player feedback we receive from our awesome community of Early Access player (thank you!)<br><br><strong>What are the next milestones?</strong><br>The game is currently being tested internally. The next big milestone will be the beginning of closed public alpha testing within first half of 2019. <br>The easiest way to stay up-to-date is to join the Steel Circus Discord community, follow Steel Circus on social media, and to sign up to our newsletter, where you’ll be the first to know about testing events, giveaways, and the latest news about Steel Circus.<br><br>Steel Circus Facebook: <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/playsteelcircus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://www.facebook.com/playsteelcircus</a><br>Steel Circus Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/playsteelcircus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >https://twitter.com/playsteelcircus</a><br>Steel Circus Discord: <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/cMGsJ7Z\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >https://discord.gg/cMGsJ7Z</a><br><br><strong>Can I expect regular updates?</strong><br>Absolutely, we have big plans to support “Steel Circus” with regular content updates and new features. There will be new champions, arenas, customizations and most importantly competitive events in the future. It’s our goal to include our players in the future progress of Steel Circus and we’re happy to invite all of you to join on us on Discord and share your thoughts, feedback and suggestions!<br><br><strong>How many champions will there be in the final game?</strong><br>We’re currently working on 5-7 champions during our upcoming testing phase, and our long-term goal as we approach launch next year is to feature 15 to 20+ champions which we’ll regularly introduce to the game, along with new content updates like customization features and new arenas. During this phase of development, we’re focused primarily on delivering a balanced and fair gameplay experience for our players while introducing new content.<br><br><strong>How many Arenas can I expect?</strong><br>There will be 5 to 10 factions in Steel Circus, each represented with at least one arena. We also plan on having multiple playfields with different layouts and gameplay elements per arena. For Early Access we plan on having 2 arenas with 2 variations each, meaning 4 different arena playfields.<br><br><strong>What about other game modes?</strong><br>For now we’re concentrating on the core competitive game mode, with our goal being to make gameplay as fun and interesting as possible from your 1st to your 1000th match. That being said we do have plans to add different game modes that add exciting variations of the core gameplay after Early Access.<br><br><strong>What will be the business model of Steel Circus?</strong><br>During Early Access there will be a few premium packages available to purchase Steel Circus. All packages will include every current and future champion for the lifetime of the game. In addition to that, there will be in-game transactions for unique cosmetic content which will not affect the core mechanics of the game. We will not include any mechanic affecting paid features, or any form of pay to win or loot boxes in the game.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/969680/extras/Timeline-小黑.png?t=1544597418\" ><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game</h2></strong><br>Steel Circus is the solar system's largest sporting event.
