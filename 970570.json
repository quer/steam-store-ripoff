                "notes": "This is visual novel in which players assume the role of a high-school student investigating a series of mysterious deaths in Tokyo. Some scenes depict still images of characters engaged in violent acts: characters threatening people with knives, strangling other characters, and involved in torture. Crime scenes are graphically depicted with extensive blood-splatter and large amounts of text detail. Corpses are frequently depicted with bloodstains and sometimes mangled fingers, dangling entrails, or exposed brains. The game also contains sexual material, in still images and text; references to sexual fetishes and masturbation. Still images also depict partially exposed breasts and buttocks. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in dialogue."
