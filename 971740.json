Unlike most Tower Defences you choose when to fire each tower individually giving you far more control over how to get different spells to work together.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs well as the Elemental spells the Wizard has a variety of trump cards at his disposal. Greater Spells create game changing moments allowing you to steal victory back from the jaws of defeat, or turn ugly goblins into cute little bunnies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe enemies come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Most as classified as standard and have varying different skills, speeds and health to deal with. However the real threat is the boss class enemies.
