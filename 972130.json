The final game will offer a free patch in the downloadable content (DLC) section that will peel off the stickers, so long as you live in a country that allows adult content.  \r\n\r\nEven while censored, the artwork clearly depicts homosexual sex between male characters. \r\n\r\nLubrication should be presumed for all scenes of anal sex. It happens off camera, as is indicated in one scene.  "
