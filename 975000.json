They function as a sort of prerequisite or turning point for a story branch. In NTY!!! whenever one of these &quot;flags&quot; is triggered, the No, Thank You!!! Button will appear in the upper left-hand corner.<br><br><br>Essentially, the NTY!!! button is comparable to a two-option choice in function: you either click it and destroy the &quot;flag&quot; or ignore it and let it stand. The main difference is that you don't know what the options are exactly or what the question is (for that, you have to pay attention to the scene and figure out what you're being asked). The button will remain on-screen for several lines. You can click it as long as it is on screen, the precise timing has no effect. If you decide not to destroy the flag (and to not click the NTY!!! button), simply ignore it and continue reading. Sometimes not clicking it is the correct option.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>This long, yet fleeting, summer vacation begins with a car crash.<br><br>One day in June, as summer draws near, our protagonist protects a man from an out-of-control car, but gets hit and loses his memory in the process.<br>The man our protagonist saved feels responsible for him, having no identification on him or any obvious leads as to his identity, and gives him a job.<br><br>He brings him to a little bar on the outskirts of downtown called 'sótano'.<br>On the outside, it looks like a cozy little jazz bar, but it has another side to it.<br><br>They take on cases that the police and legitimate detective agencies won't touch.<br>The staff there give our protagonist the name 'Haru,' and he gradually makes his way deeper into the organization while working as an apprentice bartender.",
