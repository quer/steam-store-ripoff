As the leader of a legion,you must build your own castles and expand your territory, explore unknown lands, and search for mysterious treasure, cultivate your own heroes and troops while exterminating your opponent's, and challenge the god who rules the world behind the scenes.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/0.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Legions</h2>In the original EA version, there are three legions available (which will increase in the future), the expansive HUMAN legion, crafty UNDEAD legion, and advanced STEAM legion. Each legion has 3 unique heroes, 9 specialized units, 9 spells and a set of specialized technology cards.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/01.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Procedurally Generated Worlds</h2>The worlds are procedurally generated to ensure that each game is a new experience. There are five different types of maps: Pangaea, Great Plain, Mediterranean, Islands and Ring Continent. Each game map supports up to six legions playing together.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/02.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Resources</h2>Compete for expanded access to the 4 different kinds of resources in the game: Gold, Knowledge, Industry, and Magic. Each resource can be obtained by capturing a corresponding resource on the map or by building structures in your castles.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/03.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Units</h2>Units are the main part of your legion, you need them to explore the world, find treasure, defeat enemies, and eventually conquer the gods themselves. Each legion has 9 unique units, and you can occupy a mercenary camp or a sea castle to recruit a variety of neutral units.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/04.png?t=1550559995\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/05.png?t=1550559995\" ><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/06.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Heroes</h2><br>If units are the arms and legs of your forces, then the Heroes are the backbone. Each legion has 3 unique heroes, and you can also upgrade your normal units to heroes through technology cards allowing any unit to access to talents and equipment but limiting you to one of that unit. Every Hero gets new talent trees each game and can wear six pieces of equipment to customize their use over the course of the game.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/07.png?t=1550559995\" ><br>Each hero gets a different upgrade talent in each game.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/08.png?t=1550559995\" ><br>Each hero can wear six pieces of equipment.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/09.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Magic</h2>Each legion has 9 unique spells. Casting spells consumes mana but has an immediate effect on the world. Many spells attack your enemy or assist your army while others have unique effects like peering into the fog of war or summoning fields of tombs.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/10.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Castle buildings</h2>You can spend Gold to build new buildings or upgrade old ones in your castles and sea castles. Each castle has 1 main building slot and 8 secondary building slots which become available as the castle grows over time. Will you focus on rapid growth or take a more militaristic aproach?<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/11.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Technology Cards</h2>Knowledge is used to unlock technology cards, many of which fundamentally alter how the game will play out. There are three main tech trees for each legion: economy, military, and magic which each have three levels of tech available. Each slot can be filled with one technology card of the corresponding level and higher levels are unlocked by purchasing your first card of the previous level in any given tree. Most technology cards are shared between legions, but each also has its own unique technology cards which allow them to specilize. Technology cards can increase your economic output, increase the power of your units, strengthen your spells, and much, much more.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/12.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unit Upgrade Trees</h2>The industry resource is used to purhcase upgrades for your units which are effective for all units of that type. You can completely customize your units to meat the strategic demands of each game. Each unit has its own independent talent tree through which a unit can be developed into many different functions. You can also use Industry to equip a unit with 3 different items to further cement their role in your legion.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/13.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Random events</h2>There are hundreds of random events in the game and different events will bring unexpected changes to the game as it progresses.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/14.png?t=1550559995\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Celestial Magic</h2>There are 2 celestials in the game which start off neutral to all factions. If you occupy an altar on the map, you can pay tribute to one celestial and get magic from them in return. Paying tribute to one of the celestials will bring the ire of other celestial. Once their wrath can no longer be contained, they will order their troops to attack you, or even join the field themselves.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/975270/extras/15.png?t=1550559995\" ><br><br>And even more content will be added for you to discover",
