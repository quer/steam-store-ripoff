TRY IT OUT - can be accessed by continuing from level one :)</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is this?</h2>A Cheesy Game is a back-to-the-roots platformer that strives to be easy to understand, yet difficult to master. The game’s best features are its physics, game mechanics, level creator and of course – its endless supply of puns. <br><br>Although there are tools you need to use effectively to be successful, the true challenge lies in mastering the player character itself. From the internal playtests that I have violently forced my friends into, there is truly a difference between a new and experienced player, as a player who has mastered the game’s physics will finish levels considerably faster, collect more points and die less frequently.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/976970/extras/pics1.jpg?t=1549303945\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What can you expect?</h2>The current version features a short story campaign and a simple level creator. For the best experience, I would recommend playing through the campaign first as it introduces the game's mechanics, unlocks skins and delivers a hefty amount of dairy-based puns. <br><br>The campaign contains five challenging levels with fully-voiced cheesy characters hiding in their secret rooms. Find them all to form an army and defeat the mouse emperor's general or fail and watch your family get mercilessly forked!<br><br>The level creator, even in its infant stage, is already a tool capable of creating maniacal levels straight from Grandpappi's nightmares. Try it for yourself, save your creation and share it with other players! New obstacles, features and object manipulation options will be added to the creator throughout early access.<br><br>If you decide to buy the game and help me shape it into its ultimate form, please keep in mind this is an early access build - there will be bugs and content gaps! With that being said, every purchase, recommendation, bug report and review is greatly appreciated and truly makes a difference.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/976970/extras/pics2.jpg?t=1549303945\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who made this cheesy mess?</h2>Hi! My name is Anthony and I am the sole creator of this incredibly cheesy game. The game is the result of my long and unhealthy love and obsession with video games and cheese. <br><br>This is the first ever project that I started in Unity way back in 2015. Since then I started many other projects but never got to finish them. Finally, this year, I have decided to come back to this little cheesy platformer and apply what I learned since abandoning it. The game undertook some massive changes and looks and most importantly feels very different – and better - to what it used to be. Although it still doesn’t look top notch and it’s definitely not finished, after seeing the progress I made over the last couple of years I firmly believe that with some time, money and community enthusiasm, the game will reach its true legenDAIRY potential!  <br><br>Unfortunately, as a broke student with little to no cheese to spend, I cannot afford to work on the game in my spare time as much as I'd like, that is why I decided to release it in EA on Steam.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/976970/extras/pics3.jpg?t=1549303945\" >",
