For those who want to try out the gameplay or just test the game performance on their computers before purchase, have no fear... the demo is here. This demo includes the tutorial and the first two introductory levels designed to get players accustomed to the game mechanics. As a bonus, two of the main stages are also included that are more challenging and better represent how the rest of the game is like. Purchasing the early access version will unlock the full game that contains the remaining six main stages plus the six castle stages. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/977330/extras/Story_En_Storepage.png?t=1549357590\" ><br><br>One fine morning, Ral, Mindy, AJ, and Jing go to play badminton when an evil being appears and kidnaps Mindy. Things seem pretty grim until a mysterious, old man named Lao Pi materializes and offers Ral an enchanted badminton racquet. He explains that the racquet can deflect any attack back at an enemy but cannot do direct damage by itself. Determined to rescue his friend, Ral embarks on a journey which will take him from the clouds in the sky to the depths of Hades.   <br><br>Navigate through intense, heart pounding traps and obstacles. Discover new and interesting ways to defeat your enemies. Meet a crazy cast of characters including a hockey player who thinks he is a god, a lacrosse player running an insane asylum, and a basketball player who turns his trophy into an actual wife.  Experience a storyline that pokes fun of sports figures, video games, and pop culture in general. Most importantly, become the greatest warrior of all time... a badminton warrior!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/977330/extras/Features_En_Storepage.png?t=1549357590\" ><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>2D action platforming with a unique game mechanic.
