You take the role of Alex, a seemingly average teenager from the Midwest as she is recruited into Starquake Academy, an elite training program run by the solar system’s most powerful company.  You start your training of vital knowledge needed to survive in outer space.  Through your exploration of these science concept, you explore the mysteries of Starquake Corp., the resistance movement against Starquake, and your own past.  <br><br><strong>This science adventure game aims to teach science, technology, math, and engineering topics  using immersive 3D animation and mini-games. Learn by exploring in this self-paced and  immersive learning environment.  Suitable for ages 9+.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Details:</h2>By the end of the 21st century, Earth was crippled with overpopulation and resource depletion. With nowhere left to expand on Earth, people looked to space to find new ways of providing for the endlessly growing population. Companies scrambled to find the next big thing in space exploration and solar system mining. Among them, two rose to the top: Star Odyssey Contractors, a space construction titan, and Meteor Quake Technologies, a leading asteroid mining company.<br>Foreseeing greater opportunities as a single entity, the companies merged together and became Starquake Corporation. Since then, Starquake has grown into the uncontested leader of solar system corporations, developing revolutionary methods of extracting raw space materials and delivering them to Earth. Due to its success, it was able to fund the largest Mars colonization effort in human history.<br><br>The government, wary of Starquake’s rapidly growing power, began to scrutinize the company and limit its progress. In a final push to create a comprehensive workspace, free from the restrictions of Earth, Starquake invested in robotic mining and space-based manufacturing.

The journey to Mars is 6 months, and for part of that time you are in hibernation. But the station leaders would like to start your training as you approach Mars. You are training in a virtual holographic environment, the Neo Educational eXperience Immersion Simulator (NEXIS), that helps focus your training linking lessons to puzzles and games to reinforce learning. <br><br>While in the NEXIS environment, you will learn about how lasers operate from an atomic scale through how to build a laser, as this is an important component of the propulsion system onboard the space shuttle. <br><br>Each lesson focuses on a specific element of the operation of a laser, building from fundamental concepts around atoms. <br><br><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> The lesson explains atoms, electrons and their ability to be excited. <br><br><strong>Lesson 2:</strong> Light and wavelengths of light. This lesson teaches you about photons and light, and allows you to experiment with wavelengths. <br><br><strong>Lesson 3:</strong> Excitation of an atom. This lesson explores how atoms receive energy and how that ties into the emission of light<br><br><strong>Lesson 4:</strong> Energy transfer.

You will explore how atoms interact to make light. <br><br><strong>Lesson 6:</strong> Laser light. With all the science behind how light is generated, you can now learn how a laser is assembled and how that generates a specific form of laser light. <br><br>You apply your skills through mini-games, puzzles and hands on experiments within the lessons.
