It’s a base building game where players must build spaceships from the ground up tile by tile, create optimal gas conditions, manage the needs and moods of their crew, encounter other space-faring groups, and explore the universe in a self-built haven among the stars.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/979110/extras/build_rooms_620_zoom_at_end.gif?t=1547657744\" ><br>Space Haven allows for a lot of freedom regarding building. A functional spaceship can be built tile-by tile, giving you the opportunity to shape a spaceship of your own desire. It can be symmetric and streamlined, or an asymmetrical whimsical looking thing. It does not have to look like a conventional spaceship depicted in sci-fi literature, you are free to design your own, the choice is yours!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/979110/extras/gas_simulation_620.gif?t=1547657744\" ><br>Space Haven’s core is built around the isometric tile-based gas system, which simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on a spaceship. The gas system combined with humans, plants and facilities all having their own reactions to gas levels create deep and emergent game play. When designing and building a spaceship, you need to secure facilities, optimize crew survival and well-being, but also think about possible future accidents and chaos generated from crew combat or environmental hazards. Gas conditions can be monitored using different view modes.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/979110/extras/mood_620.gif?t=1547657744\" ><br>The game simulates needs, moods, and relationships of crew members. Each crew member has their own history of life before the apocalypse, their past life occupation and hobbies will affect their skills and know-how. Crew members will develop relationships with each other, good or bad. They will want to spend more time with some, while avoiding others. Witness depression, happiness and drama surrounding different crew members as you journey onward towards a new home.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/979110/extras/starmap_01_620.gif?t=1547657744\" ><br>Explore a new randomly generated galaxy with your crew each time you start a new adventure.
