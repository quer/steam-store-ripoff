            "detailed_description": "Good Color helps you choose a good color.  It helps you do so in many different ways.  Primarily it uses color wheel theory to let you a pick a color or colors which &quot;go with&quot; one or more starting colors.  Other ways that it helps you choose a color is by:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1)Letting you import a JPEG photo from your cell phone and pick a color from that photo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2)Providing a list of well-known and not-very-well-known colors that you can select.  Do you know you must use 'mauve' or 'indigo' but you don't really know what those colors are?  Good Color provides a long list of colors you can add to your theme by just one click.  The name of these colors is on the click button AND the color of the button is the color that matches the name.  This means you can search through this list of color names by text (looking for a certain word)  or you can just look at all the colors and pick the one you want.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3)Letting you use various color models to set a color.  RGB, HSV, HSL, CMY, YIQ, and YUV color models are supported.  Perhaps you know you must use some certain color and but you only have the numeric values for that color in one model (in HSV perhaps).  Good Color lets you easily switch between all these color models.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4)Providing a large list of color themes which you can use to create your own theme.  These themes have been confirmed by online voting to be popular.  You can look through this list of themes and pick out one you like.  When you choose your first color for your theme, Good Color will find the two popular themes which most closely match your initial color (and helps you integrate such a matched theme with your selected first color).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5)Letting you change the color wheel being used.  You can slightly or greatly modify the definition of the color wheel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6)Supporting 24 foreign languages.  In Good Color you can change the foreign language in which the program's commands are displayed.  You can switch from English to Spanish for example.  You can also see the documentation in whatever foreign language you prefer.  This foreign language capability does NOT use the locale you have set on your computer.  This lets you keep your locale for your computer set to whatever language you normally prefer yet use Good Color in some other language without interfering with your base locale setting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7)Allows you to set 1 or more base colors and then use color wheel theory to choose 1 or more additional colors.  For example, if you have two colors you must use yet you need 2 more colors Good Color will use color theory to choose the remaining 2 colors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood Color can be used to choose a good matching color whenever you need to choose colors.  You could be playing a game and trying to select good matching colors for your skins.  You could be a game designer trying to find colors which your customers will like.  You could be a video artist trying to select colors that you yourself like.  You could be painting your house, choosing the color of your new car, choosing the color of your next dress, or choosing the color of your makeup.  You can always choose to select a color yourself that you think is a good match but if you want to use an accepted method of color choice then you use the color wheel and Good Color helps you use the color wheel.  Are you someone who has no idea what is a good matching color?  Let Good Color help you choose.",
