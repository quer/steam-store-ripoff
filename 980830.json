As players explore a mysterious mansion, they engage in dialogue and action choices that affect the story's outcome. Some actions lead to instances of violence, with players using various items to defend themselves or attack enemy spirits. Still-image sequences depict instances of blood and/or gore: a bloody corpse on the ground with plants bursting from the stomach; a severed arm on top of a desk. The game contains some suggestive material and nudity: dialogue/text that states, “Her pale thighs glow on the bedsheet as she poses seductively,” “Take off your bra,” and “…sexually harassing a subordinate”; a nude character lying in a pit of snakes—her breasts and pelvic region partially covered. The words “f**k” and sh*t” appear in the dialogue.\r\nThere is also a scene with a woman being tortured by having her mouth forcibly held open and being fed spiders."
