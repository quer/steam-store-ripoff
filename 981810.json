And they don’t offer easy access to travelers. So watch your paws carefully while traveling and look for maps to guide you on your way from island to island.<br><br><strong>Walk on two legs or run on all fours!</strong><br>The game combines platforming and exploration seamlessly together and focuses on the sheer joy of movement. Dash has learned a few tricks to keep himself moving, like wall-running and belly flopping to do a ground pound.<br><br><strong>Explore the islands for treasure!</strong><br>Treasure, enemies and challenges await.

The other pirates have hidden golden bones on each island, for those looking for platforming challenges.<br><br><strong>Demo version</strong><br>The demo version of 3 levels is available to download for free. We want to give everyone a chance to get into Dash’s paws before we get the full game ready. We recommend using a controller!",
