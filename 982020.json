Once unlocked, upgrades will greatly help in getting you farther than ever before, and will make the later levels of the game a little easier (on your soul).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n     Look forward to additions, including but not limited to: Coop and Versus modes, full soundtrack, new power-ups and mechanics, several new playable vehicles and maps, and (hopefully) a mobile version using touch controls. I will also be working closely with community input and suggestions to make this first game of mine not only<br />\r\nsomething I can be proud of, but something players can see grow and change based on their own feedback. I'm also excited to admit I have multiple other projects currently in progress. I plan to continue working on them after I can officially take this out of early access, so be sure to look forward to those as well... Cheers!",
