Titan was a powerful group of great gods, but it was their three sons who ended their rule: Zeus, Poseidon and Hades. Zeus became the king of gods and ruled the heavens; Poseidon became the Lord of the sea; and Hades dominated the underground. <br>Thereafter, Prometheus, the God of prophecy, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom, created man with earth. After thousands of years of human reproduction on the earth's surface, millions of people gathered together to build many city-states. Sometimes gods exert their divine power on the surface of the earth to make humans fear them.
