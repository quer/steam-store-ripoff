(Stop Time has a limit bar whereas speed up and slow down have unlimited use)\r\n\r\nChrono Ghost Abilities Mechanics Control:\r\nAll Green outlined obstacles in Chrono Ghost are affected by the time controlling mechanics, whereas all Red outlined obstacles are immune to the time control mechanics.\r\n\r\nChrono Ghost Natural Abilities:\r\nJump - Can be combined with the Dash ability and the Dash ability cool down. Short hop jumps and long extended jumps can be performed by tapping and long pressing the jumps button. \r\nCrouch - Crouch to avoid certain obstacles.\r\nDash - Has a cool down indicator above the character. Dashing out into an open space (off a ledge) + Jumping will allow Chrono Ghost to Dash again.\r\nCamera panning - (Controller) by pressing the B button allows the player to see what is in front to the right. \r\n\r\nChrono Ghost Platforms: \r\nGreen - Static, Moving, and Falling\r\nRed - Static Moving and, Falling\r\nBlue - These are bouncing platforms - The player receives a jump once reaching peak jumping height.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>As the Chrono Ghost, you have the responsibility of proving yourself to the Spirit of Time. You also seek the truth to some unanswered questions. How did you end up here? Why are you the Chrono Ghost? Who or what is the Spirit of Time? Why are you chosen to complete the Spirit of Time’s test?\r\n\r\nThe Chrono Ghost game mechanics are one of a kind. As the Chrono Ghost you have the power to speed up, slow down, and stop time. These abilities will only work on certain objects depending on color. This game tests your dexterity, reaction speed, timing, and overall ability to react to and overcome the continuous flow of obstacles. The game gets much more difficult in later levels. This is a game about precise timing. Are you up for the challenge?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: 'Full Controller Support' outside of initial launcher where you can adjust resolution and quality",
