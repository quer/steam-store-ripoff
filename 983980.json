For the infinite mode, you still need to beat 15 levels in the main game, as it can get quite difficult.<br>Also, there's a game <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discordapp.com/channels/504899099892645890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  > discord </a>.<br>Send me there any messages regarding the game, and any features and improvements you'd wish for the upcoming updates!<br><br>Wish me luck,<br>Miro</p><br><h1>Level Generator is now live!</h1><p>Hey everyone!<br>In the latest build I've uploaded you can play functional <strong>infinite levels mode</strong> if you need more challenge.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/983980/extras/proc.gif?t=1549468042\" ><br>You can access it from the main game menu, provided you've beaten first 20 levels in the main game. It generates random levels infinitely and counts you winning strike.
