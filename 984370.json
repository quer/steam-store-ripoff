Things begin to take a turn when his brother Rajveer 20, loses his patience with the locals who constantly label him as a terrorist due to his turban and beard. Despite the strong objection of their father SARJIT 50, Rajveer decides to leave home to join the Australian army. Excited at first with Rajveer's decision, Ajit soon realises the peril of war through his classmate and the news on TV. Ajit begs his father to go after Rajveer and bring him home. Sarjit relents and they race to Perth in pursuit of Rajveer. However, Sarjit crashes the car and loses his life. Ajit is then rescued by a mob of Aboriginal travelers. Together they help Ajit to cremate his father in middle of the outback. Ajit now has a new objective of making sure that Rajveer is able to perform a last prayer &quot;Antim Ardas&quot; for Sarjit within eleven days. Seeing that Ajit is alone and lost, the mob choses a reluctant TJIIDRM 12, to accompany Ajit to the city. An extremely suspicious and angry young Tjiidrm grudgingly guides Ajit in order to take Sarjit's to Rajveer. Their rivalry eventual turns to friendship when Tjiidrm begins to see that Ajit is not a threat like the 'white fellas'. This friendship is eventually sealed when Ajit reveals how his mother was gunned down in a terrorist attack back in India. This is especially poignant as we realise that Tjiidrm is also an orphan like Ajit. When they finally reach the edge of the city, Tjiidrm reveals that Ajit now has to strike out on his own. Ajit finally marches through the city in search of Rajveer but his plans are thwarted when he is lured in to a dark alley and robbed. Two young ladies, CINDY and BEV manage to scare the thief away but before Ajit could recover the note with his brother's address. Ajit runs away from them too thanks Tjiidrm who has drilled in to Ajit to not trust the white fellas or he would be place in a orphanaged and turned in to a Christan. Alone, lost and confused Ajit passes out in the street. He wakes up to find himself in Cindy's apartment who convinces him to let her help him find his brother but by the time they get there Rajveer's had already been shipped to basic training in a camp about 1200 kilometers away. Cindy then convinces Bev to persuade her boyfriend, JACK 30's who is an outback pilot to fly Ajit to the Army camp. Cindy transfers Sarjit's ashes into a metal urn as gift to Ajit. On the flight to the camp, the small plane runs into trouble and is force to land about 120 KMs from the Laverton where the camp is situated. Desperate and furious, Ajit sneaks out in the middle of the night to make up for the time that he is losing. In this chapter Ajit goes through a phase of hallucination and self discovery. He also hunts like Tjiidrm, abandoning his vegetarian practice. Ajit finally reaches the edge of the camp but is spotted by a sniper in training, in the ensuing panic and miscommunication Ajit is fired upon. The screen goes blank before we see Rajveer cradling him and screams to reveal that it is his brother. Fortunately, the metal urn took the hit and Ajit comes to. The film ends with an areal shot of Ajit and Rajveer immersing Sarjit's ashes by the ocean.",
