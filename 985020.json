            "detailed_description": "Three Kingdoms Ancient Strategy is an independent game created by me. It is a 20-30 minute strategy game of battle situation. Players can lead their three Kingdoms generals into battlefield to fight. In the game, they also need to occupy the city pool, layout economy, dispatch troops and generals to attack and fight, as well as in fog and haze weather. Thieving the city, and then other people's wartime to pack and other diverse tactics, many strategic elements will be condensed into dozens of minutes of the battle situation, of course, the most important thing is that it is not a stand-alone game, but can negotiate with other players on Battle Net games, up to 3V3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1: creative inspiration<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe original inspiration of this game is based on the kind of war in ancient times, the Great Plains can be millions of troops to fight, but the danger of barriers with thousands of soldiers can hinder hundreds of thousands of troops imagined, coupled with my own love of human-to-human war games, so I designed this product. Of course, the design concept of PK games and stand-alone games will be very different, for example, it can not be too specific (so there are very few troops), otherwise the balance in the confrontation is difficult to grasp, for example, to consider a barracks or a city with two friendly forces at the same time how to operate?

Players can take their own two computer legions to fight, the other party may be three players, or the same player as you have two computers, of course, the winning rate of 1vs3 is not high, but the system can also win the same reward for losers as long as they work hard, so losers can still benefit a lot as long as they work hard. 。",
