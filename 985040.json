You have been dropped into NPC Square, a walled off quarantine zone.  You can also fight the horde in the new NPC HQ map. This is a humorous, satirical game where you fight endless hordes of &quot;NPCs&quot; hell bent on destroying the eccentric and unique playable characters.  You observe the programming of unaware NPCs by the NPC New Organization and attempt to destroy as many bots as you can to help free the world.  Said saviors of the world include: The Bad Orange Man, Wojak/Feel Guy, Chad, Virgin, The Doomer, a 30 yr old Boomer, a Brainlet, and a Zoomer.",
