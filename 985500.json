The chain starts with your foundation card, passes through several support and monster cards, receives boosts from a variety of item cards, then ends with your hero card, who will use the stats passed on to them to battle a horde of monsters. Players with strong analytical abilities and a high degree of mathematical prowess will find themselves commanding a powerful stat chain that allows them to decimate their enemies with ease. Players with no analytical abilities and poor math skills will still succeed, but not quite as fast.<br><br>The average battle grid has 40 card slots.
