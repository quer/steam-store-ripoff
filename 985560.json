This game is similar to the game Enter the Gungeon. This is due to the level layout of the game. Like to Enter the Gungeon, Magic Mouse will have the player go through room after room to kill all the enemies and acquire loot. The main difference between Enter the Gungeon and Magic Mouse is the compact mechanics. In Enter the Gungeon the player uses guns, while in Magic Mouse the player uses their mouse to cast spells.",
