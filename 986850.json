Parque Fernando has asked for your aid in turning an otherwise wild slice of Patagonia into world class hunting grounds. Roam through the gnarled trunks of the dead forests, traverse the swamps and hills, and make your way across the grasslands as you open outposts, build lodges and prove yourself to the reserve’s fierce owner, Carolina. Only time will tell if you can turn the reserve into a hunter’s paradise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PARQUE FERNANDO’S FAUNA</h2><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/986850/extras/Fernando.gif?t=1547639563\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br>Buzzing with life, Parque Fernando sports a large range of wildlife. Get ready to spot a vibrant Cinnamon Teal taking flight, or a Blackbuck pronking as you make your way across the reserve. Not to mention the fact that the park nourishes some the biggest, most exquisite bucks you’ll ever hunt, like the Mule Deer, Red Deer and Axis Deer. Just remember: you are not the apex predator here. That job belongs to the Pumas, and they don’t like to share. This majestic feline can be spotted stalking and chasing after its prey and if you’re especially quiet, you might even find catch one feeding on its prize.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LUSH AND VIBRANT FLORA</h2><img src=\"https://media.st.dl.bscstorage.net/steam/apps/986850/extras/FGernando-_smalFlora.png?t=1547639563\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"><br>Framed by hills, Parque Fernando houses a variety of environments to explore.

While she never had enough time to tend to the unfinished reserve, she was always determined to one day finish what she and Fernando started.
