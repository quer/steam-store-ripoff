Having recently suffered the loss of her mother, Libretto has never felt more hopeless. But in the midst of her life’s biggest tragedy, an exciting opportunity makes itself known – as she receives an invitation to watch her closest friend perform at the grand re-opening of the symphony hall in town.<br><br>Soon after arriving at the hall, Libretto feels death is in the air around her…and realizes that this isn’t just any performance – but perhaps the last song that humanity might ever hear...<br><br>The Ghost of You is a 510,000+ word epic about love, loss, and survival. You make the choices that shape Libretto’s character; and you shape just what kind of an ending you get.
