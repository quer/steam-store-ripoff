The objective in each level is to pass the clock on the clock to reach the last clock, for that there will be a preset initial clock, and the route to take is free.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt may seem simple but there are several inducements that make the game more difficult than it seems:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-The clocks have different sizes between them, even at the same level. That difference in size means that there is a difference in the speed of rotation between them, making the step between them difficult.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-As the game progresses, the levels will contain more clocks in them, and in addition to the number of clocks, the distance between them will change, making the steps of the needle more difficult.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nApart from all that, the style and graphics of the game are simple and elegant, perfectly matching the theme and tone of the game",
