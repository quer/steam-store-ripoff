The main character - Warden - can move between the three lines and cast spells on each line to destroy enemies. You need to defeat 10 waves of different evil beings and prevent them from reaching the tomb entrance. The game can be completed within 10 minutes, but it’s hard enough to make you suffer for a couple of hours. It’s unbalanced and has several non-critical bugs, so try it on your own risk!<br><br><strong>Music&amp;Sounds - Xenakex Studio</strong>",
