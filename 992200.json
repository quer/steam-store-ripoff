I just wanted to see if I could do it, and I am really happy with the result. Thought I might also step out of my comfort zone and try to make something wacky for a change. It's not a deep game, but I hope it's fun. I actually tried to ignore my years in art school to come up with zany designs and level themes that I feel a 9nth grader would think is cool (or at least, travel down memory lane to the kinds of designs I thought were cool when I was a 9nth grader). For maximum enjoyment, please take it at face value, thanks!<br />\r\nSayuri~<br />\r\n---<br />\r\nBig thank you to Naoya Sakamata for the Japanese Localization and OST!",
