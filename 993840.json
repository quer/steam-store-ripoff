Sometimes you just want to jump in and get racing without all the setup and fuss. <br><br>Drive is more than just your average arcade racing game. Through VR it puts you in the car and provides a real sense of being out on the track feeling every bump and crash across a range of exciting arcade racing styles.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The VR Arcade Racing Experience</h2></strong><br>Traditional racing games let you race at 300kph, Drive lets you experience it. From the moment you jump in the car, looking around at the detailed interiors waiting for the start, you feel as though you’re out there on the track. When the light goes green your opponents will floor it and if you don’t push hard, they’ll leave you behind. <br><br>In the middle of the pack with cars inches from your doors jostling for position you’ll feel every bump and turn. They want to win as much as you do so they’ll tap and nudge you for position and not give an inch or an undeserved position. <br><br>In VR the speed and realism of the cars makes the experience intense so the question is can you hold your nerve til the end? A win in VR is so much sweeter.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Also plays in non-VR Mode</strong></h2>No headset? No problem. Drive will detect if you haven’t got a headset and adjust accordingly to play in 2D screen mode. At any stage you can also disable VR.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The AI are Bastards</strong></h2>This is an actual quote from a review of Drive. The AI opponents in Drive race just like your friends would. They are not polite or cautious, they’re out there to win and if that means a little bumping here and there then so be it. Arcade racing rules apply so don’t hesitate to stand your ground.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Standard Race Mode</strong></h2>Race against up to 19 AI opponents across the full range of tracks driving any of the cars. These races are more traditional racing with configurable practice, qualifying and racing sessions as well as the use of pits as needed. Want to jump in and race? The quick race mode lets you get into the game and start racing in seconds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Arcade Challenge Mode Racing</strong></h2>The standard VR racing experience in Drive is great fun but the challenge modes take it to a whole new level. Standard racing features apply with a bit extra to add to that arcade racing experience. Choose from Jumps, Checkpoints and a bunch of other racing challenges. The feeling in VR as your car soars through the air 10m above the ground as it passes three opponents is so satisfying.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Championships</strong></h2>In for the long haul? Drive features a range of championships designed to let you take your time and savour the joy of a racing season. Customise the length and difficulty or races within a championship then at your leisure race each track keeping an eye on the championship points as you go. A good qualifying time here really helps.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong></h2>Drive is still in early access, but we are developing the multiplayer functionality right now. Keep an eye on this page or our community page for more information on release updates for multiplayer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Cars &amp; Tracks</strong></h2>Drive currently features 4 racing cars, but this number is growing with the regular free update releases. Cars range from fast modern sports cars to karts and older classic cars. The cars all feature detailed interiors and selectable paintjobs to make sure when in VR you feel like you are in the car.<br><br>There are currently 13 tracks available, these range from city street circuits to longer country tracks and short circular loops and offer a range of driving styles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Damage, fuel, tyres and pits</strong></h2>Ever been out on the track, made a little mistake and slam your half million-dollar custom race car into a wall needing tens of thousands in repairs? Neither have we but that would really suck. Drive is great as with VR you get a great racing experience, but it doesn’t matter how much you mess up your car, it won’t cost you a cent. <br><br>Drive features vehicle damage, fuel usage and tyre wear bridging the gap between traditional arcade racers and full-blown racing sims. Plan your pitstops carefully though as they can cost you positions if not planned correctly.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Global Leader Boards</strong></h2>Think you’re the best of the best of the best of the best, or just the best of the best of the best. Either way you’re probably pretty good so make sure everyone knows it with your fastest lap times for each track posted to the Steam Global leader boards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Current Feature List (current release: Early Access Update 5)</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Built for VR racing (supports Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, WMR headsets)<br></li><li>Screen mode supported (non-VR racing)<br></li><li>Standard Races: customisable races, practice, quick race and full races with qualifying<br></li><li>Challenge Races: choose from a range of arcade style challenges including jumps and checkpoint<br></li><li>Championships<br></li><li>13 tracks<br></li><li>4 Cars with selectable paint jobs<br></li><li>Car customisation including ABS, steering stabilisation, traction control, anti-roll and choice of automatic or manual gearing.<br></li><li>Race up to 19 computer opponents<br></li><li>Vehicle damage<br></li><li>Pit system with tyre wear, fuel usage and damage repair<br></li><li>Supports wheels and controllers (with customisable input configurations)<br></li><li>XP Points and levels</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Version 1.0 Release Features:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Online multiplayer<br></li><li>Additional tracks<br></li><li>Additional cars<br></li><li>Audio updates (particularly car engines)</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Early Access, Community and Regular Updates</strong></h2>Drive is in early access and will be released as a full version 1.0 once all features are complete.
