It has a style and a very marked visual range, which fits perfectly with the simplicity of the gameplay itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this game you will simply take charge of the movements of a ball, that you will have to make it ascend as much as possible, it is perfect because besides you only need a mouse to play it.<br />\r\nThe ball will have to be supported on mobile platforms that appear, each with a different placement and movements<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs simple as this: the first touch makes the ball go up, the second will make the ball load and fall very fast. With this, the game may seem simple, but it is extremely difficult.<br />\r\nThe difficulty of the game lies in how the ball goes down and how the stage behaves. When you make the ball go down, the rest of the stage will continue to move, so you'll have to calculate the timing perfectly for the platform to reach and do not lose.",
