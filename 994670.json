Play the part of the blue team and learn about real cybersecurity controls, technology, methods, and strategies!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Play</h2>ThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue is a turn-based strategy game played much like popular global domination board games. Rather than a world map, the &quot;game board&quot; consists of a computer network, which players compete for control over. Instead of simulated computer terminals, players choose and commit actions using &quot;action cards&quot; similar to a trading card game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">By the Community...

Most of us work, or have worked, for years as cybersecurity professionals, and we all remain active members of the community. ThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue was developed and tested as a result of the feedback from more than 300 beta testers in the cybersecurity community. Our goal is to continue to make regular updates based on continued feedback, making this truly a game by the community, for the community.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single Player vs. Computer A.I.
