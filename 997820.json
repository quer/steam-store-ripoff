Once in the Battle Space the player uses right clicks to summon a unit and once this happens the battle is already underway. This game is heavy on being over powered(True to it's animation DEEPEST BLUE) and unfair being as I want it to feel more like the players are watching a anime battle rather than playing a fair game. some units have super powers like blast projectiles and immense strength, while other units are regular humans with average speed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFactions - <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEz Dojo - Ez Dojo is ran by the Ez family their father, his name being Ezoria, He has four children who are apart of his dojo and they all have super natural powers being the ability to shoot projectiles from their bodies. Including their intense monk like training they have earned insane body strength which includes physical feats and super speed. They learn to control their bodies energy in which they call Pol which is the name of their grandfather and Ezoria's Father the original creator and owner of Ez Dojo which was once called Pol Dojo. After his death it was passed down To Ezoria and the name was changed to their last name to keep it in the family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDash Brothers - The Dash Brothers are a band of brothers so far in game their are only five of them but there are ALOT more, they own a business called DASH Industry above the Battle Box dimension which is currently being hyper condensed into the world so they can continue their business in their new life.

They aren't supers, well some of them are, but they are well over what a average human in power level is, and receive training to take out the base line Supers.
