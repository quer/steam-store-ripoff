            "detailed_description": "Alana: The Leah Colony was launched for orbital construction only a few years ago. Progress was smooth at first but the death of one of their chief engineers stalled the process. Dr. Raynor was to see the colony through to completion. Up until recently, he’d resumed construction on par with prior plans. But a few weeks ago, we intercepted a distress signal from the ship. They’d been attacked. You are to locate and extract Dr. Raynor, and try to find out what the hell happened here. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMontgomery: And what if he’s dead?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlana: Then abort the mission. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Colony, you play as Captain Montgomery, a man tasked with capturing the chief engineer of a newly designed space colony, Dr. Raynor. It’s not until his approach that he learns that the colony’s been attacked and what's more, his AI navigator would see him ignore saving anyone in lieu of capturing the doctor. What secrets he holds are the only thing M Aple Industries cares about. The doctor isn't what they say he is. But as the mercenary delves deeper into the destroyed station, he must decide whether he'll complete his mission as required or throw it all aside and try to save what few people remain there.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Colony is a traditional side scrolling metroidvania created with the Unreal Engine by Monkeystein Games. Bursting with dangerous aliens, smoke, fire, blaring lights and a host of monsters and bosses, it's a taut enjoyable story with voice acting and original songs. With twin stick shooting giving you precise aim, and a seemingly never ending jet pack, explore the confines of the Leah Colony with ease, admiring the evil teddy bears, desiccated corpses and blood speckled everything this game has to offer.",
