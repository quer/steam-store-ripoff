If you managed to save all of them from 4 waves of attack, you'll go to the space and fight with lots of enemy fighters. After that, you'll jump to another planet to save another 10 civilians.

In Interceptor mode, you can fly very quickly to save Offendrons or fight with enemy fighters. In Offender mode, your thrust speed significantly decreases but you can fire your laser much faster  and you can fly up or down much quicker.
