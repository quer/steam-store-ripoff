(Doesn't it normally drag you inwards??) Well.. when you see this world you'll think &quot;Aww! It's all bruken! Everything's bruken! The world's bruken! Gravity is bruken! Goodness gracious me!&quot;. <br />\r\n:) <br />\r\nExplore this exciting new world as a little ball. I do believe that whatever caused this place to break apart like this has left lots of energy around the place. I wonder if that'll help you to overcome the ever stronger gravitational force as you get closer to the center! Hmm!<br />\r\nEither way, it's just a bit of fun! Have an explore, do the jumps, poke around the maze (or on top of the maze!) and generally just enjoy yourself. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI made this game with one goal in mind. A relaxing and fun game to play when you're keen to chill out in the afternoon (or whenever you relax really) with a bit of difficulty at the end/middle. Good luck with that by the way, gravity can be a real pain in the butt! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br />\r\n- A big ol' hand crafted world to explore (not just procedural planes....) <br />\r\n- All sorts of things to jump on/off/over/into/etc.<br />\r\n- A movement system with slight complexity to it (if you figure it out, there are a few different ways to do things).<br />\r\n- Energy system (the more you have, the better/faster/stronger na na na na what don't kill me, can only make me stronger, wait, what was I saying?)<br />\r\n- Plenty of waypoints etc.<br />\r\n- Fun, excitement, joy, bliss, the meaning of life, candy, a brand new Porche 911 2018 model with turbo chargers AND superchargers, hand crafted by angels and painted by famous artists long dead. <br />\r\n- Alright that last one may have been a stretch but... sales, amirite?",
